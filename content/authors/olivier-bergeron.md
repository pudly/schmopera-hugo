short_bio: So, I started loving opera after going to the [Camp musical de Lanaudière](http://campmusicalperelindsay.com/en/)
  (now [Camp musical Père-Lindsay](http://campmusicalperelindsay.com/en/)) at age
  12. The same year I saw my first opera (*Il barbiere di Siviglia* at the Opéra de
  Montréal), and the following year I had my first voice lesson with Virginia Zeani.
  Fast-forward to 16 years old - I made my début with the Opéra de Montréal in *Dead
  Man Walking* as the Younger Brother.

So, I started loving opera after going to the [Camp musical de Lanaudière](http://campmusicalperelindsay.com/en/) (now [Camp musical Père-Lindsay](http://campmusicalperelindsay.com/en/)) at age 12. The same year I saw my first opera (*Il barbiere di Siviglia* at the Opéra de Montréal), and the following year I had my first voice lesson with Virginia Zeani. Fast-forward to 16 years old - I made my début with the Opéra de Montréal in *Dead Man Walking* as the Younger Brother. I now study at the Conservatoire de musique de Montréal, where I recently sang the title role in Monteverdi’s *L'Orfeo*, with Aline Kutan, while studying privately with Sanford Sylvan and, still, under the guidance of Mme Zeani.
