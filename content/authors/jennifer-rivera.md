Grammy nominated artist Jennifer Rivera consistently earns praise for delivering exceptional vocalism, superb musicianship, and a powerful stage presence. Her performance of the title role in Handel's *Faramondo* with Brisbane Baroque in Australia recently earned her The Helpmann Award for best leading female performer in an opera. Her European debut as Sesto in *La clemenza di Tito* with the Teatro Regio di Torino directed by Graham Vick and conducted by Roberto Abaddo was followed by her debut with the Berlin Staatsoper as Rosina in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, as well as Nerone in a new production of *Agrippina* conducted by Rene Jacobs. She was then invited to sing Licida in *Lâ€™Olimpiade* by Pergolesi at the Innsbruck Early Music Festival, and returned to the Berlin Staatsoper as Rosina, and as Ismene in a new production of *Antigone* by Traetta conducted by Maestro Jacobs.
