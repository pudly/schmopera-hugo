Dr. Mark Wilkinson has led a joyful professional life unhindered by boundaries, combining the best of the arts, movement, science, and leadership into a career as an actor/opera singer, photographer, yoga teacher, writer, public servant, English-French translator, fervent volunteer, and voice care specialist.

He has been seen and heard on stages, screens, and soundwaves throughout Canada as a baritone soloist, recitalist, chamber musician, voice-over artist, and national anthem singer. He owes a debt of gratitude to all of his colleagues, whose generosity in sharing the stage has taught him so much.

Most recently, Dr. Mark completed the Doctor of Musical Arts degree at The Ohio State University under the tutelage of Dr. Scott McCoy and with the collaboration of the College of Medicine and Department of Speech and Hearing Science. He specializes in the care of the professional voice user, singing-related vocal pathologies and rehabilitation, voice science, and public health-related impacts of voice use (infectious diseases, environment, and nutrition).

Dr. Mark travels all over to give masterclasses and workshops in singing, voice care, acting for singers, learning science, and curriculum development. From individuals and groups to conservatory and university voice programs, he welcomes any and all inquiries about the human voice at [mlesliewilkinson@gmail.com](mailto:mlesliewilkinson@gmail.com.).
