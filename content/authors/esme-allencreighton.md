She most recently left positions as a Philadelphia Orchestra Teaching artist, Serafin Quartet member and professor at the University of Delaware.  Independent projects have included "Justice Tales", a multi-media production addressing racism through original music for oral history recordings, viola, and violin, choreography, spoken word, photography and historical essay.
