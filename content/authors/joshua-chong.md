Joshua Chong is a Toronto-based freelance performing arts critic and journalist whose work has been published in The Globe and Mail, Intermission Magazine, The Dance Current, and The Whole Note. In 2019, he was selected to join the National Ballet of Canada’s Emerging Arts Critics Programme, which pairs early-career critics with established writers and arts publications across Canada. He also runs his own theatre criticism blog [Ghost Light Reviews](https://jldwchong.wixsite.com/ghostlightreviews).

Joshua is currently an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying English and French. He recently served as the associate features editor of The Varsity, U of T’s student publication. In 2021, he won a John H. McDonald Award for Excellence in Student Journalism for his three-part investigation into allegations of discrimination and anti-Black racism at Trinity College. 

If he’s not at a theatre, you can see Joshua cheering on the Toronto Raptors, playing the violin, or hitting the ski slopes.
