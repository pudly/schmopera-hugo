Sam Darling born in France and raised by a notable family of artists traveled the world in her mother's theatre trunk. She settled in New York City and embarked on her own performance career but hung that up to work as a screenwriter in Hollywood. She's since bounced around the planet with her own progeny and settled in Vancouver, BC, in 2014. Her love of fellow creatives means she's all about supporting wild ideas and imaginative schemes with a special soft spot for opera and inclusive spaces that amplify marginalized voices. Carry on fellow weirdlings.
