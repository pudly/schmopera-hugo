Erik has been heard as both a soloist and as a collaborative pianist in his native Pacific Northwest, as well as in major cities including Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York City. Most recently, Erik was Music Director of the National Tour of the Broadway show, Cabaret. *Broadway World* stated, "Flaten and his band are given their own richly deserved moments in the spotlight at the top of Act Two and the music director himself is given the well-earned final bow at the end of the curtain call." This summer, Erik served as the conductor of the acclaimed Off-Broadway production of *Sweeney Todd*. 

Erik currently resides in Philadelphia, where he coaches and plays for a diverse range of singers. In addition to coaching and playing, Erik works as Music Director for musical theater, manages a private studio, and serves as Artistic Director of the Media Performing Arts Series. Previous successes include performances with mezzo-soprano, Angela Niederloh and baritone, Matthew Hayward in Portland, and a performance of the Grieg piano concerto with the West Seattle Symphony. Upcoming engagements on the East Coast include collaborative work with with soprano, Leah Golub.

Erik's research interests include new music, particularly American opera, and the ways in which new commissions are tied to social progress and cultural economics. Above all, Erik has a love for opera, and is constantly seeking ways to do his part in keeping the art form alive and relevant.
