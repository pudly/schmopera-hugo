As a journalist, Eva has been covering international news and business for over 30 years and more recently, she started interviewing opera singers to satisfy her curiosity about their story behind the story. While she lived in New York City, she would walk by the Metropolitan Opera on her way to work and sometimes stop in for a ticket for the evening performance. Since then, she has become an avid opera goer wherever she’s lived, in New York, in Paris, and now in San Diego, which also provides easy access via the freeway to the Los Angeles Opera. Sadly, she is not a singer and not a musician, but puts all her passion and enthusiasm into listening, watching, and appreciating beautiful music.
