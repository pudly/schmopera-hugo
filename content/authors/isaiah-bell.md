Canadian-American tenor Isaiah Bell sings across North America as a soloist in concert and opera. Having distinguished himself early as an interpreter of Handel, Benjamin Britten, and Bach's Evangelists (Lincoln Center, Edinburgh Festival, Aldeburgh Festival, Toronto Symphony), he has also found an artistic home in new creations and in creative re-interpretations of classic works. This upcoming season, Bell makes two role debuts as Peter Quint in Britten's _Turn of the Screw_ (Pacific Opera Victoria), and as Steva in Janaček's _Jenůfa_ (Opéra de Montréal). He looks forward to engagements with the Colorado Symphony, Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, and Ottawa Choral Society.

Recent engagements for Isaiah included a return to _La Reine-garçon_ (Canadian Opera Company), Haydn's _Creation_ with both the Vancouver Symphony and the Elora Festival, Beethoven's Ninth with the Naples Philharmonic, and Handel's _Messiah_ with conductors Nicholas McGegan (Edmonton Symphony, Calgary Philharmonic) and Trevor Pinnock (National Arts Centre Orchestra).

He created the role of Antinous, lover to Thomas Hampson's Roman emperor, in Rufus Wainwright and Daniel MacIvor's _Hadrian_ at the Canadian Opera Company, and was lauded for his "immense stage presence" and "powerful, beautiful instrument" as the Machiavellian fop Johan Oxenstierna in the 2024 premiere of _La Reine-garçon_ (Bilodeau/Bouchard) at Opéra de Montréal. On his queer pandemic-era adaptation and translation of Poulenc's _La voix humaine_, _Opera Canada_ wrote, "Bell's finely tuned performance is so perfectly married to his own sensitive and intelligent adaptation that the viewer is irrevocably drawn into [its] unfolding."

Critical response highlights Isaiah's diversity as a singer and stage performer. Frequently singled out for singing of "uncommon warmth," "smooth-as-silk coloratura" and his "elegant sense of phrasing," he also commands a "strong, glorious voice with heroic, oratorio-style ring"; a balance of "tenderness and sweetness" with "power and urgency." His dramatic portrayals have drawn special note for "vivid characterization" (_Opera_ Magazine), "exquisite poignancy" (_The New York Times_), and "[the] timing of a polished professional, well versed in delicacies of tone" (Vancouver Sun). In particular, his Madwoman in Britten's _Curlew River_ earned this rave in _The New York Times_: "Tenor Isaiah Bell gives a performance of haunting beauty, ideally depicting emotional distraction with ultimate economy and glowing vocal skill…. he has only to lower his eyelids or tip his head for it to pierce the heart." 

Isaiah complements his performance practice with composing and writing for the theatre, most notably in his chamber-opera / cabaret-theatre solo show _The Book of My Shames_. The piece, a co-creation with director Sean Guist around Isaiah's own words and music, has toured Canada in versions for piano, chamber ensemble, and orchestra. It consistently surprises audiences with its genre-defying, funny, and shockingly candid theatrical fusion, and their responses have been overwhelming: "impossibly beautiful" … "broke my heart wide open with the pure honesty, raw vulnerability and humanity of it" ... "I honestly thought this was one of the most compelling shows I've ever seen.:

He also premieres a new interdisciplinary concert project, "Let Us Turn Aside" (featuring an experimental physical interpretation of Satie's meditative late masterpiece _Socrate_) and returns to back-by-popular-demand dates of "Banned from the Concert Hall" (a three-tenor mashup of bawdy Baroque songs, created by Isaiah for Victoria Baroque and Early Music Vancouver). Isaiah appears on the newly released world premiere recording of Mendelssohn's arrangement of the _Matthew Passion_, with the Bach Choir of Bethlehem.
