This season, soprano Alexandra Delle Donne will be pursing her Graduate Degree in Historical Performance at the University of Toronto. She completed her Bachelor's degree in classical Voice Performance at the University of Toronto. Alexandra will be performing with the Opera In Concert (OIC) under the direction of Guillermo Silva-Marin and Robert Cooper. Alexandra will also be a featured soloist in _Acis and Galatea_ under the direction of Larry Beckcwith, Isaiah Bell, and Eric Thor. She will also be a soloist in Purcell's _King Arthur_ under the direction of Christopher Bagen and Eric Thor. 

This past June Alexandra had the privilege to participate in the Tafelmusik Baroque Summer Institute, under the direction of Ivars Taurins. She had the pleasure of working with Vera Causa Opera in Kitchener/Waterloo, and performed in the chorus for Puccini's _Le Villi_ and Donizetti's _The Elixir of Love_. Alexandra also premiered in Dylan Langan's _Dracula_, as Wife #1. 

Alexandra has been singing classically for twelve years, and studies with Krisztina Szabo. In the past she has performed with the COC in _La Bohème_, and _Carmen_ due to her participation with the Canadian Children’s Opera Company (CCOC) in Toronto. Alexandra was with the CCOC for six years performing in numerous operas and concerts such as, _The Magical Land of Og_, _Laura’s Cow_, and _Dickens of a Christmas_. 

When she is not performing in operas and choral events, Alexandra enjoys competing in numerous voice competitions, such as NATS, ORMTA, and Guelph Kiwanis. In 2013 and 2014 she came in first place for the ORMTA Provincials Grade 9+ in Toronto, as well as achieving first place for the NATS provincial Women’s Junior Division in 2013 and 2014 in Indiana, and Michigan. In 2015 she won first place in the ORMTA regionals, and in 2016 had the pleasure of performing at the Sicilia Canta where she embraced her Sicilian heritage.
