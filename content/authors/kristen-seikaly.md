Kristen Seikaly began her blog in January of 2015, accompanying her studies and professional experience as a young singer. She's candid and fresh in her writing, asking important questions that often go overlooked among young artists. She's a great writer, and she's also a hardworking mezzo-soprano.

Hailed as an “energetic” and “engaging performer”, mezzo-soprano Kristen Seikaly is a vivacious performer with a warm sound and a deep understanding of character. She pursues excellence in all of her musical endeavors, and seeks to uphold the integrity of the music and characters above all else.

Kristen’s full roles include *Iolanta* (Laura), and *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* (Moth) at Westminster Choir College, and *L’elisir d’amore* (Giannetta) at University of Michigan. Kristen has also performed scene excerpts from *Le nozze di Figaro* (Cherubino), *Così fan tutte* (Dorabella), and *Hansel and Gretel* (Hansel). She has also performed operas and scene excerpts in Italy and France.

Kristen’s passion extends beyond the opera stage and goes deep into art song. At Westminster Choir College, she performed excerpts from Dominick Argento’s *From the Diary of Virginia Woolf* in the 2014 Westminster Art Song Festival, where she collaborated with JJ Penna. She was also a Young Artist at Songfest in Los Angeles in 2012 where she had the honor of coaching with great musicians of art song such as Martin Katz and Jake Heggie.

Kristen holds degrees from Westminster Choir college (Master of Music) and University of Michigan (Bachelor of Music). Her teachers have included Sally Wolf and Martha Sheil and coaches have included JJ Penna and Laurie Rogers.
