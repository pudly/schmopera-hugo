As Artistic Director and Composer-Conductor, Sung Jin Hong is dedicated to integrating One
World Symphony into the fabric of the community through adventurous programming, inspiring
performances, benefit concerts, and audience engagement. The symphony has extended its
activism with benefit concerts and civic events that serve to heal, uplift, and empower. Hong and One World Symphony have collaborated with many local and global organizations, such as
SAVI (Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention Program of Mount Sinai), NY Presbyterian Weill
Cornell’s Heart Institute, Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, The Humane Society of NY, Ramakrishna
Vivekananda Center of NY, The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Make-A- Wish
Foundation, Harlem Children&#39;s Zone, United Spinal Association, Coalition for the Homeless,
Uniformed Firefighter’s Association Widows’ and Children’s Fund (9/11), and the American Red
Cross: Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami Relief Fund, Haiti Relief and Development Fund,
Hurricane Katrina Victims Relief Fund, and the Tsunami Victims Fund.

Hong’s conducting engagements included Lyrique-en- mer in France, Stadt Wien
Konservatorium in Vienna, Royal Northern Conservatory in Manchester, Tulsa Symphony, Tulsa
Ballet, Manhattan School of Music, Mannes, CUNY Grad Center, Bard College, Illinois
Wesleyan University, Redlands University, Bradley University, and Western Illinois University.
He had the honor of being chosen by Kurt Masur to conduct in masterclasses and a concert
with Manhattan School of Music Symphony. Hong made his international recording debut as a
conductor under the Naxos record label.

As a conductor, he has had the honor of presenting world premieres and works by living
composers such as John Adams, John Corigliano, George Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Harold
Farberman, Kyle Gann, John Harbison, George Perle, Andre Previn, Steve Reich, Kaija
Saariaho, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Joan Tower, Rob Adler, Keith Bailey, Lisa Burke, Jason Candler,
John Craven, James Cross, Jerry DeVore, Peter Gilbert, Leonard Goldfine, Stanley Grill, Sean
Hickey, Jihwan Kim, Justin Lee, Michael Mandrin, Masashi Mori, Andrew Struck-Marcell, and
Margarita Zelenaia. After conducting works by many composers during One World Symphony’s
first nine seasons, Sung Jin Hong programmed From The Alchemist, inspired by Paulo Coelho’s
novel, in September 2009, which also was his first work that was publicly performed by One
World Symphony. The work was later heard at the NY International Fringe Festival.

Besides the acclaimed world premiere Operasodes ® *Breaking Bad—Ozymandias* (2014) and
*Hannibal* (2015), Hong has been committed to exploring resonating human issues and
“defending equality and human values through powerful art and civic action” through his
compositions: mental illness and suicide in *Edge* (2013, based on Sylvia Plath’s final poem),
impermanence and the life cycle in *Rite of Cicada* (2013), and reclaiming one’s identity in *Eye of the Storm* (2010, inspired by his return to his homeland and his experience visiting the DMZ). Hong’s most recent composition DEFIANT (2017) was inspired by Michelle Obama’s speech “Shaken me to my core,” Chaplin’s *The Great Dictator*, Langston Hughes’ *Dream Deferred*, and Hangang (한강).

Hong’s writing has been published by Berlin’s VAN Magazine, Toronto’s Schmopera, San
Francisco Classical Voice, and The Brooklyn Paper.
