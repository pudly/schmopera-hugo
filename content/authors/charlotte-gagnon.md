Praised for her amber-colored tone and warm vocal agility, as well as her engaging and charming stage presence, Charlotte is a true passionate of words, theatre, and of the exceptional dramatic freedom that offers the lyric repertoire from the Baroque era to the contemporary creations.

Her impressive rigour and musical integrity have enabled her to perform for various internationally renowned ensembles and companies, such as Ensemble Caprice, Tafelmusik, Tapestry Opera, Jeunesses Musicales Canada, the Orchestre de chambre de McGill, Clavecin en concert, The Choir of the Church of St-Andrew and St-Paul, the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, and the Société de Musique Contemporaine du Québec. She has also obtained the support of the George-Cédric-Ferguson foundation and Les amis de l’art; has been awarded the first prize at the Newmarket Voice Festival Senior Scholarship Competition in 2012; and reached the semi-finals of the resident artist competition at the Opéra National de Paris in 2017.

A true believer in accessible culture for everyone and a passionate in developing artistic practices in cultural mediation, Charlotte has created Opéra 101 with pianist Laurence Lambert-Chan in 2015, a burlesque operatic concert where classical music meets clowning art. The concert is broadcasted by SAMS and Espace La Risée in Montreal.
