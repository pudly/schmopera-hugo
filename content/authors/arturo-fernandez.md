Arturo Fernandez is a composer, violist, Thereminist, and writer currently based in Boston. A native of Miami, he earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in composition from the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati, and holds other composition degrees from the Cleveland Institute of Music and the Boston Conservatory. He hopes to add his own contributions to the operatic repertory down the line.

He has had experience across all aspects of opera production: he assisted in staging a production of *The Cunning Little Vixen* at CCM, has played in orchestra pits for companies including the Ohio Light Opera and the Boston Opera Collaborative, and he has written the music and the libretto for two chamber operas over the course of his schooling. As someone who loves the opera theater, he is looking forward to contributing to Schmopera covering Boston's opera scene.
