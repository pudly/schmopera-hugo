Meghan Klinkenborg is a soprano, writer, and opera fangirl residing in Des Moines, Iowa. Her love of opera is saturated with high levels of snark and sarcasm, and she is always ready to rant about her favorite art form to anyone who will listen. She spends most of her spare time in her library, lording over her hoard of books like a greedy dragon.

Meghan obtained her Bachelor of Music degree at Simpson College and her Master of Music
degree at University of Minnesota-Duluth. She has recently returned to her hometown of Des Moines and is looking to expand the operatic opportunities in her community. Her ultimate goal is to give people a unique perspective on opera and hopefully impart some of her excess enthusiasm on potential converts.
