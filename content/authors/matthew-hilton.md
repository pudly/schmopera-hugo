I'm a sixties kid from Notting Hill now turning into a grain of light in the hills south-east of Toulouse. After Art School I worked for Welfare State International theatre before becoming a fireman in West Yorkshire. I re-emerged as an artist in 1982 and went on to have a career with a London gallery.  My graphic work has been collected by, amongst others: Freud Museum London, Government Collection Whitehall, Kasser Foundation, United States, British Council, Bibliothèque Nationale France. From time to time I supported my practice by working as a surveyor of unclassified roads, an energy grant inspector, a museum photographer, a caretaker for holiday homes and a bird scarer at RAF Marham. I broke the pattern by moving to France and boosted my writing with two graphic/literary productions: an erotic memoir: _My way of loving Beasts_ and the journal of an immigrant: _De La Franqui à Ramonville_. I then wrote a libretto _Mau Mau - the Opera_ before turning to ebooks. 

I am currently working on a landscape inspired series of lithographs.
