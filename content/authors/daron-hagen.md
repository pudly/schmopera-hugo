Because of the broad audience appeal and practicality of his nine operas, new productions and revivals occur frequently with international companies (Seattle Opera, Opera Ireland), regionals (Sarasota Opera, Kentucky Opera, Madison Opera, Tulsa Opera, Skylight Music Theater), independents (Opera Theater of Pittsburgh, West Edge Opera, Center for Contemporary Opera, Opera Vista), colleges (UK Opera, Moores Opera Center, Roosevelt University, Butler Opera Center, La Sierra College, USC), and high schools (Pittsburgh HS for the Performing Arts)

He has conducted recordings of his operas (*Bandanna*), served as artistic director (Seasons Music Festival), and is currently chair of composition studies (Wintergreen Summer Music Academy) for music festivals, and served on academic faculties (Bard College, the Curtis Institute, Princeton Atelier). He appears regularly as a collaborative pianist with composer / vocalist Gilda Lyons. The duo has created a series of concerts called "Pairings" in which arias, popular songs, and music theater numbers are rearranged and combined in new ways to highlight their commonalities and themes. He made his debut as a stage director with Kentucky Opera and has directed productions at Symphony Space in New York City, the Actors Theatre of Louisville, and the McCarter Theater in Princeton (New York Stories, The Antient Concert, A Woman in Morocco). A prolific writer, he contributes regularly to the *Huffington Post* and other online media, has co-written several of the libretti to his operas (New York Stories, A Woman in Morocco), and is writing the libretto for 9/10, an opera for six singers and pre-recorded sound.
