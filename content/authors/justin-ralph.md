Known for his powerful voice and vibrant stage presence, Justin Ralph is a singer-songwriter whose opera powered folk peformances always make for a unique and exciting live show. With influences from early Americana and Canadiana music to Hank Williams and Pavarotti, his passionate performances have people taking notice across the country.

On the musical theatre and opera scene, Justin has performed roles across Ontario and the East Coast - some highlights include Alfred in Opera Five's smash hit production of *Die Fledermaus*, Marius in *Les Miserables* with the Sudbury Symphony and Yes! Theatre, and Judas in *Jesus Christ Superstar* with Confidential Musical Theatre Project Ottawa. 

Lately, Justin has taken a keen interest in helping other performers overcome the anxiety and depression that come hand in hand with being a artist, particularly through the use of meditation and mindfulness. He hopes that opening up about his own struggles with anxiety may help artists come to suffer less from their own

On his debut EP outlaws, betrayed lovers, and soulful ruminations come to life with banjo, guitar, mandolin, and piano, led by Ralph's powerful voice. Travelling a line between country, folk, and bluegrass, the troubadour and his banjo paint tales, both dark and light, of a simpler time. Order the EP [here](https://justinralph.com/music).
