In 2003, Kwak graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University, where he studied the history of medicine and medical ethics and wrote an honors thesis on the history of trust in the physician-patient relationship. Kwak spent a year abroad at Oxford University, on fellowship from Harvard, where he earned a master's degree in Comparative Social Policy, writing an honors dissertation on patients' rights legislation in the United States and in the United Kingdom.
