"I sing. I write. I overthink. That’s about it."

Marcia Whitehead is a singer, writer and survivor of one woman show with a plot twist she didn't see coming. A vocal detour landed her the leading role of Patient and Soul Searcher as she worked her way through seven years of doctors and procedures, yoga mats and side hustles until she finally woke up to a new voice and a new mission: Help the singers. And repeat.

In the midst of retraining as a newly minted Soprano she wrote and performed her one woman show, _Clean Slate_, with [Soulo Theatre](https://www.soulo.ca/soulo-theatre) in June 2020. The autobiographical story zoomed in on the risks she took on the road to vocal recovery. She then created [Clean Slate - A Singer's Story Forum](https://www.facebook.com/SingersStoryForum/?view_public_for=100776468397073) which gives singers an open mic to share their vocal challenges and triumphs.

2021 projects and collaborations include: online Talks and Masterclasses on Patience, Perseverance and the Personal Investments needed to build a Resilient Voice; studying Mindfulness, Meditation, Neuroscience and Brain Chemistry at McMaster University, and writing a memoir.

An alumnus of L'Atelier Lyrique de L'Opéra de Montréal Marcia spent 15 years singing professionally as soloist on Canada's Operatic and Symphonic stages.

Her most notable portrayals in her previous fach included the title roles in _Carmen_ and _La Cenerentola_; Dorabella in _Così fan tutte_; Third Lady in The _Magic Flute_; l'enfant in _L’enfant et les sortilèges_; Hänsel in _Hänsel und Gretel_; the Page in _Salome_; and Lola in _Cavalleria Rusticana_. New operatic works, included Jeanne d'Arc in _Electric Flesh_ with the National Opera of Lyon; Jaan in _Noor over Afghan_ at CanStage’s Festival of Ideas and Creation; and as Cixious in _Trudeau: Long March/Shining Path_, a jazz-inspired opera by George Elliot Clarke and D.D. Jackson.

On the concert stage, Marcia's solo repertoire included Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_, Vivaldi’s _Gloria_ and Mozart's _Requiem_. As well, she produced 2 solo cabarets; _Single in the City_, and its sequel, _Britches, Bitches & Witches: A Mezzo Soprano Survival Guide_.
