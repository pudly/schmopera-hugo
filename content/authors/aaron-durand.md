An enthusiastic, coffee-loving baritone hailing from 100 Mile House, BC, Aaron Durand began singing lessons at the age of nine, but knew nothing of opera until a chance viewing of *Carmen* in Vancouver at age 16. Consumed by the wonderful music, Aaron tackled a bachelor's degree in music followed by a master's degree, both at UBC, where he performed as part of the celebrated UBC Opera Ensemble across Canada, China and eastern Europe. After graduating in 2012, Aaron joined Vancouver Opera's Yulanda M. Faris program for its inaugural year, performing roles in several mainstage productions including *La boh√®me*, *The Pirates of Penzance*, *Albert Herring* and *Don Giovanni*.
