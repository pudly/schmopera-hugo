Polina is an opera critic and UI/UX designer. She started her way as an art critic, holding her own gallery of contemporary art and design in Russia. She fell in love with opera immediately once she watched Andris Nelsons’ Inaugural Concert @BSO with Jonas Kaufmann and Kristine Opolais. *Don Carlo*, *Parsifal*, *Maria Stuarda*, and *Fidelio* are among her favorites. She travels a lot to enjoy an architecture and design, she also knows everything about speciality coffee. 

Once Polina felt, that opera is not just a hobby anymore, she shifted to part-time job and began to study music theory and watch as many opera as she could. Now she lives in Vilnius and works part-time as a designer, as well as travels across the Europe to review operas for different media. Polina speaks Russian, English, Italian, and Lithuanian.
