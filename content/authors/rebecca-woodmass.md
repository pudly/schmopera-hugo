Praised by reviewers as “luminous” (La Scena Musicale) and “mesmerizing” (Weisensel), RC Woodmass (they/them) was a coloratura soprano who specialized in new music and extended vocal and physical techniques. Described by composer Jason Noble as “a true gift to composers,” possessing an “astonishingly beautiful, agile and powerful voice,” RC premiered works by composers including Pierre Michaud, Scott Shell, Kota Nakamura, Christa Marie Emerson, Mauro Lanza, and Hunter Long. As part of the Opera America conference in Montreal, they collaborated with contemporary opera company Chants Libres to premiere the role of Young Patricia in Kristin Norderval’s The Trials of Patricia Isasa under Pauline Vaillancourt and Cristian Gort. Other career highlights include premiering Hunter Long’s Drawing Down the Moon (Luminary Arts, St. Louis, MO), John Tavener’s Requiem (North American Premier; Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra), and Pierre Michaud’s opera Le rêve de Grégoire (Chants Libres, Montreal). They also worked with Ensemble MusikFabrik on Claude Vivier’s lively Hiérophanie, performed in Canada for the first time as part of the Montreal New Music Festival. They are no longer active as a classical singer, and are now exploring other modes of expression, including design, pottery, drawing, painting, and songwriting.
