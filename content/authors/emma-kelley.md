Emma Kelley was born and raised in the city of Chicago, a Global Studies graduate of University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, and knows all dialogue to the *Lord of the Rings* movies. Her opera enthusiasm began at the young age of 12 after seeing Gounod's *Faust* for the very first time. If she can’t be found at the local coffee shop furiously typing on her laptop, she's the one tragically underdressed at any opera performance.
