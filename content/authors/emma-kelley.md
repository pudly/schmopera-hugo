short_bio: Emma Kelley was born and raised in the city of Chicago, a Global Studies
  graduate of University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, and knows all dialogue to the
  *Lord of the Rings* movies. Her opera enthusiasm began at the young age of 12 after
  seeing Gounod&#039;s *Faust* for the very first time. If she can’t be found at the
  local coffee shop furiously typing on her laptop, she&#039;s the one tragically
  underdressed at any opera performance.
