After making his European stage debut as Fenton in the new production of *Falstaff* at the Cologne Opera in October of 2016, Armenian tenor Liparit Avetisyan has been invited to make several other important debuts in the current season: Rodolfo in *La Boheme* with the Frankfurt Opera and Alfredo in *La Traviata* with Opera Australia in Sydney. In the 2017/18 season, Avetisyan will sing Alfredo at the Hamburg State Opera, Berlin State Opera and Semperoper Dresden, and appear as Rodolfo at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. He will also make his French stage debut as Lensky in *Eugene Onegin* at the Opera du Rhin in Strasbourg and adds the role of Nemorino in *L’Elisir d’Amore* to his repertoire in Dresden.

In October of 2015, Avetisyan sang Don Jose in Alexander Titel’s new production of *Carmen* in Yekaterinburg, subsequently making his Moscow debut in January of 2016 as Des Grieux in the new production of Massenet’s *Manon* at the Staniskalvy-Nemirovich-Danchenko Opera. He returned there in June of 2016 as the Prince in the new staging of Prokofiev’s *The Love for Three Oranges* and as Almaviva in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia*. Avetisyan also participated in the company’s tour of China in *Carmen*.

During his studies, Avetisyan won Second Prize in both the Maria Biesu International Singing Competition and the III Muslim Magomaev International Vocalists Contest. At the Armenian National Academic Opera, he has sung Alfredo, Don Jose, and the old Gypsy in *Aleko*. Avetisyan sang his first performances of Rodolfo, the Duke in *Rigoletto*, and the Verdi and Mozart *Requiems* with the Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra.
