During his studies, Avetisyan won Second Prize in both the Maria Biesu International Singing Competition and the III Muslim Magomaev International Vocalists Contest. At the Armenian National Academic Opera, he has sung Alfredo, Don Jose, and the old Gypsy in *Aleko*. Avetisyan sang his first performances of Rodolfo, the Duke in *Rigoletto*, and the Verdi and Mozart *Requiems* with the Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra.
