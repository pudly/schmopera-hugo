Praised for her beautiful lyric mezzo-soprano voice (*Opera Canada*), and coloratura to die for (*Hamilton Spectator*) Erin Lawson has been attracting attention on opera and concert stages across Canada. A past member of both Calgary Opera’s Emerging Artist Program, and Pacific Opera Victoria’s Resident Artist Program, her engaging stage presence has captivated audiences in repertoire ranging from Handel and Rossini, to newly created works.
 
Recent operatic highlights include Marcellina in *La Nozze di Figaro* with Pacific Opera Victoria, Emilia in *Otello* and the title role in Handel’s *Ariodante*, both with Calgary Opera.  Erin made her debut with Edmonton Opera as Pitti-Sing in *The Mikado*. She gave an acclaimed performance in St. John’s Newfoundland, singing the title role in Britten’s *The Rape of Lucretia*. Erin has appeared as Flora in *La Traviata* with Saskatoon Opera, and was feaured twice with Opera Hamilton, first in *La Traviata*, and again in their opera in concert series Popera.  She has enjoyed bringing opera to audiences further afield touring the east coast of Canada with the Jeunesse Musicales, as Rosina in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* and then the west coast with Vancovuer Opera in Schools, singing the title role in *La Cenerentola*.  Other memorable moments on stage include Hermia in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, Sesto in *Giulio Cesare*, Hansel in *Hansel and Gretel*, Meg Page in *Falstaff*, and Third Lady in *Die Zauberflöte*.
 
With a voice that shows an exceptionally strong core, Ms. Lawson is equally at home on oratorio and concert stages, with repertoire including  Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, Durafle’s *Requiem*, Mendelssohn’s *Elijah*, Handel’s *Messiah*, Vivaldi’s *Gloria*, Rossini’s *Petite Messe Solennelle*, and Pergolesi’s *Stabat Mater*.
