	I grew up in a family full of musicians and artists, and have been a singer ever since I can remember. My father, William (Bill) Richard Braun went to Opera School and subsequently sang many comprimario roles with the Canadian Opera Company, and his brother Victor was a world-renowned Baritone. My mother, Eleanor (Smith) Braun, was with the Hamilton Philharmonic, and subsequently the Niagara Symphony, as Principal Flute. How very fortunate, to have such musical roots. I would be remiss not to mention how much I admire my talented cousins, Russell and Adi Braun...I have big footsteps to follow.... and this feeds my desire to learn as much as I can and to improve more and more each year.

<p>
	<span class="s1">The CCOC was where it all started; I still remember being part of the 1975 production of "I Pagliacci" with the Canadian Opera Company. It ignited a passion in me!</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">My Choral background is steeped in Church Music, from Trinity United Church Choir (Lloyd Bradshaw, Toronto) to The Ridley Singers (Michael Tansley, St. Catharines), St Thomas Anglican Church Choir (David Marsden, St Catharines), Knox Presbyterian Church Choir (Ken Hutton, St Catharines), and most recently, 5 years in The Orpheus Choir of Toronto under the brilliant baton of Robert Cooper. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">A high school vocal music class with the wonderful Theresa (Monaghan) Pothier was a terrific learning ground, with two great opportunities to lead our Musicals as Yum-Yum in the Mikado and Nellie in South Pacific. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">From there I also participated with Garden City Productions, in "Ragtime to Riches" and "Gershwin First Person" with Tom Inglis and Ross Inglis on duelling pianos. These two shows were choreographed by the fantastic Diane Nyland-Proctor.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">I have sung various Church Solos and weddings and would love to do more of this. In particular, I aspire to sing Oratorio works and to do some Lieder Recitals.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">2013 found me preparing for my first operatic lead role, as Frasquita in Toronto City Opera's February 2014 production of Carmen ~ it was a dream come true!</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">All of this has lead to a recording session, 10 full hours resulting in 16 tracks that were surprising to me in their results! I would like to thank Peter Krochak for his beautiful piano accompaniment, always sensitive to timing and so very musical in his interpretation. Thanks also to Brahm Goldhamer who spent many hours with me preparing ~ as our Artistic Advisor!</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">Recently I have sung my debut as a soloist in two Cantatas, appearing with Choralis Camerata in St. Catharines. The works, fittingly chosen for St. Cecilia's Day, were Britten's 'A Ceremony of Carols' and Bach's 'Wachet Auf'. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="s1">I am on to the next thing, preparing for a role debut as Oscar in Verdi's 'Un Ballo in Maschera' with Opera by Request, followed by a role debut as Barbarina in Mozart's 'Le Nozze di Figaro', with Toronto Summer Opera Workshop!</span>
