One of today’s most sought-after conductors, acclaimed worldwide for his incisive musicianship and adventurous artistic commitment, Vladimir Jurowski was born in Moscow in 1972, and completed the first part of his musical studies at the Music College of the Moscow Conservatory. In 1990 he relocated with his family to Germany, continuing his studies at the Musikhochschule of Dresden and Berlin, studying conducting with Rolf Reuter and vocal coaching with Semion Skigin. In 1995 he made his international debut at the Wexford Festival conducting Rimsky-Korsakov’s *May Night*, and the same year saw his debut at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden with *Nabucco*.

In October 2015, Vladimir Jurowski was announced as the next Chief Conductor and Artistic Director of the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin, a position he will take up from the 17/18 season. He was appointed Principal Guest Conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 2003, becoming the orchestra’s Principal Conductor in September 2007. He also holds the titles of Principal Artist of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Artistic Director of the Russian State Academic Symphony Orchestra, and Artistic Director of the George Enescu International Festival, Bucharest. He has previously held the positions of First Kapellmeister of the Komische Oper Berlin (1997-2000), Principal Guest Conductor of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna (2000-2003), Principal Guest Conductor of the Russian National Orchestra (2005-2009) and Music Director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera (2001-2013).

Vladimir Jurowski enjoys close relationships with the world’s most distinguished artistic institutions. He works annually with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, and appears regularly with the London Philharmonic at festivals including the BBC Proms, the George Enescu Festival of Bucharest, Musikfest Berlin, and the Schleswig Holstein and Rostropovich Festivals. He collaborates with many of the world’s leading orchestras including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, the Cleveland and Philadelphia Orchestras, New York Philharmonic, Chicago and Boston Symphonies, and has also conducted the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic Orchestras.

Recent highlights include performances of *Boris Godunov*, uniting the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with the orchestra of the Mikhailovsky Theatre in St Petersburg, his debut at the Salzburg Easter Festival at the helm of the Staatskapelle Dresden, appearances with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra at the Lucerne Festival and a unique project with the London Sinfonietta in Moscow to celebrate the Anglo-Russian Year of Cultural Exchange. With the State Academic Symphony of Russia he has developed a highly individual and celebrated profile in Moscow with a strong focus on contemporary repertoire, and curated projects, most recently a series of performances exploring treatments of Shakespeare in Soviet music, theatre and cinema.

Highlights of the 2016/17 season and beyond include his return visits to the New York Philharmonic, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Staatskapelle Dresden, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, and a performance of Prokofiev’s Semyon Kotko with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic at the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. He will lead the London Philharmonic in repertoire including *Das Rheingold*, *Fidelio*, Mahler’s Eighth Symphony and Penderecki’s *St Luke’s Passion*, and bring the orchestra to major cities including Vienna, Budapest and New York’s Lincoln Center.

A committed operatic conductor, Jurowski made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera New York in 1999 with *Rigoletto*, and has since returned for *Jenufa*, *The Queen of Spades*, *Hansel und Gretel* and *Die Frau ohne Schatten*. He has conducted *Parsifal* and *Wozzeck* at the Welsh National Opera, *War and Peace* at the Opera National de Paris, *Eugene Onegin* at Teatro alla Scala Milan, *Ruslan and Ludmila* at the Bolshoi Theatre, *Salome* with the State Academic Symphony of Russia, and *Iolanta* and *Der Teufel von Loudon* at the Semperoper Dresden, as well as *Die Zauberflöte*, *La Cenerentola*, *Otello*, *Macbeth*, *Falstaff*, *Tristan und Isolde*, *Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg*, *Don Giovanni*, *The Rake’s Progress*, *The Cunning Little Vixen*, *Ariadne auf Naxos* and Peter Eötvös’ *Love and Other Demons* at Glyndebourne Opera. In 2015 he returned to the Komische Oper Berlin for a universally-acclaimed new production of *Moses und Aron*, and made his debut at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich with Prokofiev’s *The Fiery Angel*. Future highlights include his Salzburg Festival debut with *Wozzeck*, and his first return to Glyndebourne as a guest conductor, to lead the world premiere production of Brett Dean’s *Hamlet*.

Jurowski’s discography with the London Philharmonic Orchestra includes the complete symphonies of Brahms, Mahler’s First and Second Symphonies, Tchaikovsky’s Symphonies 1, 4, 5, 6 and Manfred, and works by Turnage, Holst, Britten, Vaughan Williams, Shostakovich, Honegger, Haydn, Zemlinsky and Rachmaninov. He has also recorded Schnittke’s Third Symphony with the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin, and a series of Russian works with the Russian National Orchestra for PentaTone Records, works by Mendelssohn and Mahler with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and wide-ranging repertoire from Meyerbeer to Kancheli. His tenure as Music Director at Glyndebourne has been documented in numerous CD and DVD releases including award-winning productions of *Tristan und Isolde*, *Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg*, *Ariadne auf Naxos*, *Falstaff*, *La Cenerentola*, Rachmaninov’s *The Miserly Knight* and Prokofiev’s *Betrothal in a Monastery*.
