Acadian tenor Jacques Arsenault began his musical career as a virtuoso accordionist while growing up on Prince Edward Island before discovering his vocal talents. After receiving his Master of Music from University of Alberta, Jacques made his professional debut in 2015 as **Pritschitsch** in Edmonton Opera's _The Merry Widow_. Jacques joined the cast as **Kaspar** in Opera Nuova’s production of _Amahl and the Night Visitors_, and starred as **Archie** in _Archiebaldo_, Cowtown Opera’s raunchy operatic cabaret for Calgary Opera’s summertime “Opera in the Village”.

Jacques starred as **Freddy** in Tapestry Opera’s 2017 premiere of _Bandits in the Valley_, based on local history of 1860s smugglers, earning nominations for two BroadwayWorld/Toronto Awards (Best Leading Actor in a Musical and Best Performance by a Male in a Featured Role) for his “standout performance…an impressive combination of powerful singing, solid accordion chops…and heartfelt acting” (Jenna Simeonov, Schmopera).

Jacques made his debut as **Ambroise Lepine** in _Louis Riel_ (Somers) in the Canadian Opera Company’s acclaimed production at the National Arts Centre and displayed his comedic skills as **Alfred** in _Die Fledermaus_ at Glenn Gould School in Toronto.

In Montreal, Jacques sang several roles in José Evangelista’s _Le Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse_ with la Société de Musique Contemporaine de Québec. Judy-Ann Desrosiers (L’Opéra) wrote of his performance : « L\[a\] brillant\[e\] interpréta\[tion\]… de Jacques Arsenault dans le génial numéro du géomètre mérit\[e\] d’être soulign\[é\] ».

In 2019, Jacques will portray **Lui** in his own project, a male adaptation of Poulenc’s _La Voix humaine_ in collaboration with Against the Grain Theatre, and returns to National Arts Centre as **Don Basilio** and **Don Curzio** in _Le Nozze di Figaro_.
