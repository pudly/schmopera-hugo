Michelle Bradley, a recent graduate of the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, is beginning to garner great acclaim as one of today’s most promising Verdi soprano.

This season, Ms. Bradley will make debuts with the Vienna State Opera as Leonora in _Il Trovatore_ (a role debut), the San Francisco Opera as Elvira in _Ernani_, the San Diego Opera as the title role in _Aida_ and will return to the Metropolitan Opera for their New Year’s Eve Gala as Liù in Act II of _Turandot_. She will appear in solo recital at the Kennedy Center and perform Barber’s _Knoxville, Summer of 1915_ with the New World Symphony. Future projects include debuts with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and returns to the Metropolitan Opera, all in leading roles.

Last season, Ms. Bradley made a string of notable debuts in Frankfurt for Leonora in a new production of _La Forza del Destino_, in Nancy and Erfurt for the title role in _Aida_, at the Deutsche Oper Berlin for the soprano solo in staged performances of the Verdi _Requiem_. In concert, she debuted in Paris as the soprano solo in Sir Michael Tippett’s _A Child of our Time_ with the Orchestre de Paris under Thomas Adès, sang the soprano solo in Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick Nézet-Séguin and sang in recital under the auspices of the George London Foundation in Miami and New York City.

Prior to that, Ms. Bradley returned to the Metropolitan Opera as Clotilde in the new David McVicar production of _Norma_. She also appeared in Santiago de Chile as Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_. On the concert stage the soprano made her debut at   the May Festival in the Verdi _Requiem_, sang the _Four Last Songs_ with the Santa Cruz Symphony, a program of Chausson and Caplet chamber works with the New World Symphony and solo recitals in Palm Beach and Santiago de Chile. In the Metropolitan Opera’s 2016-2017 season, Ms. Bradley made debuts in Mozart’s _Idomeneo_ and as the High Priestess in Verdi’s _Aida_. Other engagements included recitals at the Théâtre du Châtelet and at New York’s Park Avenue Armory and a return to Santa Cruz for Verdi’s _Messa da Requiem_.
