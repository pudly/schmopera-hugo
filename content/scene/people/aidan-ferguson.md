Aidan Ferguson is gaining a strong reputation for her beautiful artistry and ability. Following her recent performance of Mère Marie de L’Incarnation with l’Opéra de Montréal, the Montreal Gazette wrote, “Aidan Ferguson produced the strongest singing of the evening.” Ms. Ferguson established her career as a mezzo-soprano both across Canada and as a member of Theater Basel in Switzerland, where she appeared as Emilia in *Otello*, Nicklausse in *Les Contes d’Hoffmann*, the title role in *the Rape of Lucretia*, and Zweite Magd in Strauss’ *Daphne*. Since returning to Canada, she has re-focused her repertoire, moving toward soprano roles under the mentorship of Frances Ginzer. Ms. Ferguson’s 2017 season continues with the Overseer in Edmonton Opera’s *Elektra*, which she recently sang for l’Opéra de Montréal.

While still performing as a mezzo-soprano she was heard in Messiah with the Edmonton and Winnipeg symphonies, Palmeri’s *Misa a Buenos Aires* at the Lanaudiere Festival in Québec, *Weihnachtsoratorium* for the Victoria Symphony as well as with Yannick Nézet-Séguin and l’Orchestre Métropolitain and Dryad in *Ariadne auf Naxos* for Pacific Opera Victoria. Further credits include Flora in *La Traviata* and Marcellina in *Le nozze di Figaro* for l’Opéra de Montréal, Carmela in *La Vida Breve* with the Toronto Symphony, and Mozart’s *Requiem* with Edmonton’s Pro Coro. Ms. Ferguson is an Alumna of Opéra de Montréal’s Atelier Lyrique and has received grants from the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation.
