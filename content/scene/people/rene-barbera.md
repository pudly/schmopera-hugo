Tenor René Barbera has quickly established himself as one of today's most exciting vocal artists. The first-ever recipient of all three top awards of the Operalia Competition in 2011 and winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 2008, René has earned critical praise and audience acclaim for his effortless singing, his "old-fashioned warmth" (Opera News), and his expressive musicality.

In the 2024-25 season, René will make major role debuts with _Roberto Devereux_ at Teatro di San Carlo, Arnold _Guillaume Tell_ at New National Theatre Tokyo, and Gennaro _Lucrezia Borgia_ at Teatro dell’Opera di Roma. He will begin the season with a return to Dutch National Opera in the role of Duca di Mantua _Rigoletto_ and makes a debut at Teatro Regio Torino as Nemorino _L'elisir d'amore_. Other roles in this season include returns to the roles of Arturo _I Puritani_ at Tiroler Festspiele Erl, Nemorino _L'elisir d'amore_ at Teatro Massimo Palermo and Duca di Mantua _Rigoletto_ at Los Angeles Opera. On the concert scene he will sing Verdi's _Requiem_ at Concertgebouw Amsterdam and an Opera for Peace Concert at the Eiffel Tower.

In the 2023-24 season, René performed the roles of Ernesto Don Pasquale and Alfredo _La Traviata_ at Opéra national de Paris, Ricardo Percy _Anna Bolena_ at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Don Ottativo _Don Giovanni_ at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, and Il Conte d'Almaviva _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ at the Arena di Verona.
