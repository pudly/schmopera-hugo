Lauded for his “profoundly startling vocal resonance” (_The New York Times_) and “sweet and melancholy sound” (_The Washington Post_), Daniel Moody is celebrated for his interpretations of contemporary and baroque opera and as a soloist with orchestra.

Moody recently made debuts at the **Metropolitan Opera** in Brett Dean’s **_Hamlet_** as Rosencrantz, **Atlanta Opera** as Tolomeo in **_Giulio Cesare_**_,_ and **Cincinnati Opera** as Nerone in Monteverdi’s **_L’incoronazione di Poppea_**, where the _American Record Guide_ praised his performance for its “utter beauty…where he would start singing ever so sweetly and then just let his voice blossom out into something big and round and smooth.”

Other roles for the 2022-2023 season include Special Weapons Officer in Peter Knell’s **_Arkhipov_** presented by Jacaranda in Los Angeles, Cooper/Qingu in Elena Ruehr’s **_Cosmic Cowboy_** by **White Snake Projects** in Boston, and **Vancouver Opera** debut as Oberon in Britten’s **_A Midsummer Night’s Dream_**.

A proponent of new music, Moody starred in a leading role in the world premiere of Hannah Lash’s chamber opera **_Desire_**, presented at Columbia University’s Miller Theater in collaboration with the JACK Quartet. Moody also worked with Nico Muhly on his song cycles at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue in New York City. In 2016, Moody gave the American premiere of George Benjamin’s _Dream of the Song_ at the Festival of Contemporary Music at **Tanglewood Festival**.

Moody is a frequent soloist of leading symphonic and baroque orchestras, including appearances with Apollo’s Fire, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado, Philharmonia Baroque, and Les Violons du Roy. His appearance with Philharmonia Baroque alongside mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and conductor Nicholas McGegan was described as a “combination of tenderness and theatrical verve” (_San Francisco Chronicle_). Daniel has been featured in a number of Mark Morris’ productions, including Britten’s _Curlew River_ and Purcell’s _Dido and Aeneas_ at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and at the Tanglewood Music Festival where the _Financial Times_ noted his “inspired and absorbing performances.” He has worked with such conductors as Daniella Candillari, Nicholas Carter, David Hill, Nicholas Kramer, Bernard Labadie, Ken Lam, Nicholas McGegan, Robert Moody, Thomas Søndergård, Jeannette Sorrell, Masaaki Suzuki, Kent Tritle, and Gary Wedow.

In 2018-2019, Moody made his solo debut at **Carnegie Hall Stern Auditorium** with the **Oratorio Society of New York**. Later that week, he performed on the same stage as a soloist with **Musica Sacra**. Moody’s tapestry of early music collaborations include **Boston**, **Indianapolis** and **Washington Early Music Festivals**, **Staunton Music Festival**, baroque band **Acronym** at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, **Early Music New York, Early Music Access Project, Gamut Bach Ensemble** presented by **Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, La Fiocco**, and **Mountainside Baroque Portland Baroque Orchestra,** and **San Diego Bach Collegium**, and **Three Notch’d Road** - The Virginia Baroque Ensemble.

A sought after Handelian countertenor, Moody previously performed the title roles in **_Giulio Cesare_** and **_Rinaldo_**, **Arsamene** in **_Xerxes_**, **Lichas** in **_Hercules_**, and **Didymus** in **_Theodora_**.

A graduate of the prestigious Yale Voxtet, resident at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, Moody has performed as a soloist at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall, London’s St. John’s Smith Square, and Cambridge’s Trinity College. His performances have been broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 in the United Kingdom, on Boston’s WGBH, Indiana’s WFIU, and WSHU’s Sunday Baroque.

Moody is also a graduate of the Peabody Conservatory and has won several awards in the Metropolitan National Council Auditions, George London Competition, Handel Aria Competition, New York Oratorio Society Competition, and Russell Wonderlic Competition.
