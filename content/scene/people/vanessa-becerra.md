Emerging soprano Vanessa Becerra has received acclaim for her “opulent” and “silvery” voice, and for her dynamic stage presence. A graduate of LA Opera’s Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist Program, her performances during her tenure included Papagena in *Die Zauberflöte*, Barbarina in *Le nozze di Figaro*, and Annina in *La traviata*. She was also featured as Gossip 2 in the Grammy nominated recording of *The Ghosts of Versailles*. A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Ms. Becerra made her professional debut with Fort Worth Opera in 2014, in the highly acclaimed production of *With Blood With Ink* for which she was praised for her “passionate theatrical intensity” (Wall Street Journal) and  her “irresistible characterization” (Opera News).

Most recently she made her Opera San Jose debut as Musetta in *La bohème*, sang in *Hercules v. Vampires* for North Carolina Opera, was heard in Handel’s *Messiah* with San Antonio Symphony, and returned to The Glimmerglass Festival as Laurey in *Oklahoma!*.

The 2017-2018 season brings a year of many debuts for Ms. Becerra. She begins the season with the LA Phil in a concert of selections from Mozart’s *The Magic Flute*, in which Ms. Becerra sings Papagena under the baton of Music Director Gustavo Dudamel. Other debuts include her Lyric Opera of Chicago debut in their Lyric Unlimited production of Greg Spears’ *Fellow Travelers* as Miss Lightfoot; her Opera Omaha debut as Glauce in Medea conducted by Jane Glover; and her Atlanta Opera debut as Johanna in *Sweeney Todd*. Further performances include a concert of music by Donizetti with The Dallas Opera at the Winspear Opera House and Sophie in *Werther* with Baltimore Concert Opera and Opera Delaware.

Ms. Becerra enjoys a long relationship with The Glimmerglass Festival where she was a member of the famed young artist program. In the summer of 2015 she covered Pamina in *The Magic Flute* and returned as a young artist the following summer to portray Musetta where she was described as a “scene-stealing minx with a glorious soprano voice.” Other training programs for Ms. Becerra include the Apprentice Program at Des Moines Metro Opera (2014) and Wolf Trap Opera’s Studio Artist Program (2013). Ms. Becerra also studied at the Seagle Music Colony where she performed the roles of Zerlina in *Don Giovanni* and Johanna in *Sweeney Todd*.
