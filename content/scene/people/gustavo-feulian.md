Hailed by the _New York Times_ as "rich voiced" and by _Opera News_ for his "interesting and convincing portrayal of Scarpia, most impressive in Te Deum" in _Tosca_, Argentinean-American baritone, Gustavo Feulien, continues his career with great success.

Most recently, Gustavo performed as Scarpia in _Tosca_ with Maryland Symphony Orchestra and this season he will perform this role with Gulfshore Symphony.

For his New York City Opera debut as Silvio in _Pagliacci_, critics hailed his performance for his "sharp, powerful gestures in both his acting and singing, was both ardent and tender" and "the love scene with Silvio, rakishly sung by Gustavo Feulien, drew bravos from many in the audience". This season, Gustavo will sing Silvio with Boheme Opera in New Jersey. Gustavo made his role debuts as Marcello in _La Bohème_ with Wichita Grand Opera, as Scarpia in _Tosca_ with Loft Opera and with Gulfshore Opera he sang as Sharpless in their productions of _Madame Butterfly_.

Gustavo Feulien made a successful European opera debut as Belcore in _L'elisir d'amore_ and as Count Almaviva in _Le nozze di Figaro_ as a regular guest artist with Theater Bremen in Germany.

His American career was launched with his Carnegie Hall debut in Faure's _Requiem_ and with DiCapo Opera, Gustavo Feulien was part of a US tour singing Silvio in _Pagliacci_.

With Opera in Williamsburg he performed as Conde di Luna in _Il Trovatore_. One of his signature roles is Escamillo in _Carmen_ which he performed in New York, Virginia and Montreal, Canada; as well as the title role in _Don Giovanni_, which he has performed throughout Argentina.

Over the last seasons, Gustavo Feulien has extended his repertoire to include some new Russian signature roles such as the title role in _Eugene Onegin_, performed in Brooklyn, New York and in Tel Aviv, Israel where he received the IVAI Price for International Singer and Robert in Tchaikovsky's _Iolanta_ performed with Di Capo Opera in NYC.

His debut with Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires was as the baritone soloist in Carmina Burana. Feulien was part of the international cast of Verdi's _La forza del destino_. He returned to Teatro Colón as the Herald in _Lohengrin_ and participated in the production of _Don Giovanni_. He also took part in the world premiere of Mario Peruso's modern opera _Fedra_ as Teramenes and performed at the 100th Anniversary of Teatro Colon's Celebration Gala. With Opera de Puerto Rico Feulien has performed as Malatesta in _Don Pasquale_, Belcore in _L'elisir d'amore_, and the Conde in the Zarzuela _La leyenda del beso_.

Honors and awards for Gustavo Feulien include the Argentinian Music Critics Association Award for his performances in _Lohengrin_ and _Fedra_ and was Finalist at the Hans Gabor Belvedere and Monserrat Caballe's Competition.
