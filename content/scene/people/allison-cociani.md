Allison Cociani was born in Vancouver and grew up in the Okanagan Valley, where she studied piano and then voice with her early mentor Aurora Hamill. At the Victoria Conservatory of Music under Karen Smith, she completed a teaching and performing diploma. Allison moved to Italy to perform and study, working on Italian repertoire and language with baritone Nicolo Ceriani. In concert Allison has performed in Ancona, Pesaro, Trieste, Montreal, Vancouver and other cities across British Columbia. In 2005 she was awarded second place in the Canadian National Voice Competition. 

Recently she appeared onstage with Opera Mariposa in _La Serva Padrona_, where she was hailed as “a delight to watch and hear” (Review Vancouver), and in Menotti’s _The Telephone_. Other notable roles include Susanna - _Marriage of Figaro_, and the Queen of the Night - _The Magic Flute_. Her passion for singing is clear in her work as a composer, appearing in the title role for her first opera, _Alma_ in June of 2017 at the Metro Theatre in Vancouver. Along with new music compositions, she has written several scores for video games, and has been a busy artist in the electronic genre. As East Van Opera’s artistic director, she continually creates opportunities for young composers and performers to pursue their musical dreams.
