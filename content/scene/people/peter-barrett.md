A recipient of the Ian Rosenblatt Bursary at the Wexford Festival in Ireland and a top prizewinner at the Montreal International Music Competition, baritone Peter Barrett is one of Canada’s most important and acclaimed artists on the opera and concert stage. Recent and upcoming engagements include Valentin in _Faust_ for the Vancouver Opera and his return to the Metropolitan Opera as cover artist for Dandini in _La Cenerentola_ and Lord Cecil in _Maria Stuarda_.

Peter’s 2021-2022 season includes appearances at the Canadian Opera Company in their digital production of Puccini’s _Gianni Schicchi_, a return to Edmonton Opera for Marcello in their production of _La bohème_, and the premiere of _R.U.R. Torrent of Light_ with Tapestry Opera.

In past seasons, Barrett covered Mercutio in _Romeo et Juliette_ and Morales in _Carmen_ at the Met, sang Wolseley in _Louis Riel_ at the Canadian Opera Company, Mozart’s _Requiem_ with the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra, and Emile De Becque in Rodgers & Hammerstein’s _South Pacific_ with the Calgary Opera.

The Newfoundlander made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Malatesta in _Don Pasquale_ opposite Anna Netrebko and subsequently covered the role of Dr. Falke in _Die Fledermaus_. An alumnus of the Ensemble Studio of the Canadian Opera Company, Barrett has appeared with the COC in many roles, including Dr. Falke in _Die Fledermaus_, Marcello in _La bohème,_ Denisov/Rayevsky in _War and Peace_, Ned Keene in _Peter Grimes_, the Mandarin and Ping in _Turandot_, Marullo in _Rigoletto_, Dancaïro and Morales in _Carmen_, Harlequin in _Ariadne auf Naxos_, and in Janacek’s _From the House of the Dead_. He has also appeared throughout the country with Vancouver Opera among others.

Other performances from previous seasons include Marcello in _La bohème_ for the Minnesota Opera, Rodrigo in _Don Carlos_ and Dancaïro in _Carmen_ for the Vancouver Opera, Figaro in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ for Opera Lyra Ottawa, the King in Conrad Susa’s _Transformations_ for the Wexford Festival, and _The Nightingale and Other Short Fables_ at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. As a concert artist, Barrett has also been heard in Handel’s _Messiah_ with the Newfoundland Symphony, Brahms’ _Deutsches Requiem_ with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and Hamilton’s Bach Elgar Choir, Rossini’s _Petite Messe Solennelle_ with the Bach Elgar Choir, and _Carmina Burana_ with the Regina Philharmonic, Windsor Symphony, Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, and Ottawa Choral Society. He also appeared in concerts in London and Toronto with the Associates of the Royal Conservatory, focused on the music of German and Austrian émigré composers in England during the Second World War, and made a special guest appearance as a soloist in the ‘Luminato’ gala concert at Roy Thomson Hall.

Peter Barrett studied at Hartwick College in the United States, attended Tanglewood’s Music Institute and graduated from the Glenn Gould Professional School at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, where he studied under Roxolana Roslak and Peter Tiefenbach. Further credits include the “Galaxy Rising Star” prize for most promising young artist at the 32nd Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s National Competition for Young Performers.
