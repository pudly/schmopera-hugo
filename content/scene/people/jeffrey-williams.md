American baritone Jeffrey Williams has been hailed by Baltimore Sun, as “very likeable, a winning performance sung with much confidence, phrasing everything stylishly,” and by Miami Herald as possessing a “commanding, sizeable, effortless, manly baritone.”

Mr. Williams’ 2015-2016 season begins with the role of the Mandarin in Nashville Opera’s mainstage production of Puccini’s *Turandot* in Andrew Jackson Hall.  Later that month, he will reprise the role of Luiz in Evan Mack’s opera, *Angel of the Amazon*, in New York state celebrating the life of Sister Dorothy Stang.  In December, he will sing multiple scenes of Mack’s new opera, *Roscoe*, based on William Kennedy’s novel depicting New York’s gritty political life, with the Skidmore College Orchestra and lead a vocal masterclass for Skidmore College voice students.  2016 begins with an evening of Russian Romances performed by Williams and his Fall 2015 Directed Study students in APSU’s Mabry Concert Hall.  Gateway Chamber Orchestra‘s Masterworks Series Concert 3 includes Mr. Williams’ premiering of Jeffrey Wood’s dramatic cycle of songs for baritone and orchestra entitled, *Different Bodies*, based on Kenneth Sherman’s “Words for Elephant Man.”  In March 2016, Williams will be the baritone soloist in Samuel Barber’s The Lovers with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in their annual Voices of Spring program at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center.  In April, Williams returns to the Bach in Baltimore concert series to perform Bach’s beloved bass solo church cantata, BWV 82, “Ich habe genug.”

Williams’ 2014-2015 season included two recordings for Albany Records, Thomas Sleeper’s series of eight operas entitled *Einstein’s Inconsistency* (currently available) and Michael Dellaira’s riveting one-act opera *The Death of Webern* (soon to be released).
