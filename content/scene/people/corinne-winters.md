Acclaimed by The New York Times as “an outstanding actress, as well as a singer of extraordinary grace and finesse”, soprano Corinne Winters is a recent nominee in the International Opera Awards Young Singer category. In the 2015/16 season, Corinne debuts with Opernhaus Zürich as Melisande in a new production of Pelléas et Mélisande directed by Dmitri Tcherniakov. She makes dual role and orchestra debuts as Alice Ford alongside Ambrogio Maestri’s Falstaff with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, and as Fiordiligi in Così fan tutte with the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia under the baton of Semyon Bychkov. Corinne returns to the English National Opera as Mimì in a new Benedict Andrews production of La bohème, and makes her role debut as Desdemona in a new production of Otello with Opera Vlaanderen.

Corinne’s 2014/2015 season included debuts with Washington National Opera as Mimì in a new production of La bohème and Opera Vlaanderen as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. Return engagements included role debuts as Tatiana in Eugene Onegin with Arizona Opera and Magda in La rondine with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. In recital, Corinne performed with Steven Blier of the New York Festival of Song at the Tucson Desert Song Festival and Vocal Arts DC, showcasing Spanish song repertoire from her debut album Canción amorosa.

In the 2013/14 season, Corinne debuted with the Santa Fe Opera as Soong Ching-ling in the American premiere of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Kentucky Opera as Mimì, Michigan Opera Theatre as Violetta in La traviata, and Virginia Opera as Micaëla in Carmen. She joined tenor Matthew Polenzani in recital for the George London Foundation and was praised by Opera News as “a striking brunette who manages to be simultaneously gamine and seductress, reveal[ing] an arresting, uniquely plum-colored soprano that could pass for mezzo in the middle but explodes with vibrant color on top.”

Corinne also recently debuted as Juliette in Roméo et Juliette with Arizona Opera and Violetta with Opera Hong Kong, Opera Lyra Ottawa, and English National Opera, which BBC Music Magazine deemed “a performance of white-hot intensity and consummate control.” Immediate reengagements included Teresa in Benvenuto Cellini with English National Opera and Mimì with Arizona Opera, along with returns to Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as Vendulka in Smetana’s The Kiss, the National Symphony Orchestra as Violetta, and the Metropolitan Opera to cover Blanche de la Force in Les Dialogues des Carmélites. Future seasons include debuts with the Seattle Opera, San Diego Opera, and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden.

Corinne has won prizes from Wolf Trap Opera’s Shouse Career Grant, the Mabel Dorn Reeder Foundation, Marcello Giordani Foundation (1st prize, Critics Choice Award, Vero Beach Prize), George London Foundation (George London/Leonie Rysanek Award), Sullivan Foundation (Career Grant), Licia Albanese Puccini Foundation (1st Prize), Palm Beach Opera Competition (1st Prize), Gerda Lissner Foundation (2nd Prize), and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (National Semifinalist, 1st place New England Region).

Originally from Frederick, MD, Corinne earned a Master of Music degree in vocal performance from the Peabody Conservatory and Bachelor of Science degree magna cum laude from Towson University before appearing as a resident artist at the prestigious Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia. Currently, she studies with world-renowned soprano Diana Soviero.
