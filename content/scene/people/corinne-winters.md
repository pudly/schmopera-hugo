Acclaimed by _The New York Times_ as "an outstanding actress, as well as a singer of extraordinary grace and finesse," American soprano Corinne Winters has performed over thirty leading roles at major opera houses around the world. 

Corinne begins her 23-24 season as a featured soloist with the Sun Symphony Orchestra for the opening of the new Ho Guam opera house in Hanoi, Vietnam followed by her debut with the Berliner Philharmoniker for performances of Dvořák's _Stabat Mater_ and a return to the Orchestra dell' Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia for Dvořák's _The Spectre's Bride_, both conducted by Jakub Hrůša. For her debut at the Teatro Real, Corinne will reprise the title role in Moniuszko's _Halka_ in concert, alongside Piotr Beczała. This season also marks her debut at the Wiener Staatsoper in the title role of _Rusalka_, a role she will debut at Opéra Royal de Wallonie-Liège earlier in the season. Further operatic appearances include returning to two of her signature roles, first Violetta Valéry in one New Year's Eve performance of _La Traviata_ at Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre, followed by Madama Butterfly at Opéra Nice Côte d'Azur and San Diego Opera. Ms. Winters will close her 23/24 season with her debut at Festival d'Aix-en-Provence as both title roles in C.W. Glück's _Iphigénie en Aulide_ et _Iphigénie en Tauride_. Future seasons include debuts with Dvořák Prague Festival, Bayerische Staatsoper, Houston Grand Opera, Staatsoper Berlin, and the Metropolitan Opera, among others.

Directly following her triumphant debut as the title role in Barrie Kosky's new _Kát'a Kabanová_ at the Salzburger Festspiele, Corinne has brought her signature role to the Grand Théâtre de Genève, the Janáček Brno International Festival, Staatsoper Stuttgart, and Opéra de Lyon in the 22-23 season. She also returned to Teatro dell'Opera di Roma for her role debut as Blanche de la Force in Emma Dante's new production of _Dialogues des Carmélites_, conducted by Michele Mariotti, and debuted with the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia in València as both Mimì in _La bohème_ and the title role in _Jenůfa_. Corinne's 22-23 season concert engagements included Strauss's _Vier letzte Lieder_ with the Bamberger Symphoniker at the Wiener Musikverein and a Janáček concert with the Orchestra dell' Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, both conducted by Jakub Hrůša, as well as a gala concert of arias with Andrea Battistoni and the Orchestre de Opéra Royal de Wallonie-Liège. 

Career highlights include the title roles in _Madama Butterfly_ and _Kát'a Kabanová_ with Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, Tchaikovsky's _Iolanta_ at Oper Frankfurt, Giorgetta in _Il Tabarro_ and the title role in _Suor Angelica_ at La Monnaie / De Munt, Jenůfa at the Grand Théâtre de Genève, Moniuszko's Halka at Theater an der Wien, Mélisande in _Pelléas et Mélisande_ at Opernhaus Zürich, Rachel in _La Juive_ and Desdemona in _Otello_ at Opera Vlaanderen, Mimì in _La bohème_ at Washington National Opera, and Violetta in _La traviata_ at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, Opera Australia, Opera Hong Kong, English National Opera, and Seattle Opera.

In concert, Corinne has sung the soprano solo in Verdi's _Requiem_ on a European tour with the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, led by Sir John Eliot Gardiner, _Les nuits d’été_ with the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra, and Bachianas Brasileiras with True Concord. She joined tenor Matthew Polenzani in recital for the George London Foundation, where she was praised by _Opera News_ as "a striking brunette who manages to be simultaneously gamine and seductress, reveal[ing] an arresting, uniquely plum-colored soprano that could pass for mezzo in the middle but explodes with vibrant color on top." She has also appeared in recital with the New York Festival of Song, Tucson Desert Song Festival, and Vocal Arts DC, showcasing Spanish song repertoire from her debut album, _Canción amorosa_.

An International Opera Awards nominee, Corinne has won prizes from the Mabel Dorn Reeder Foundation, Marcello Giordani Foundation (1st prize, Critics Choice Award, Vero Beach Prize), George London Foundation (George London/Leonie Rysanek Award), Sullivan Foundation (Career Grant), Licia Albanese Puccini Foundation (1st Prize), Palm Beach Opera Competition (1st Prize), Gerda Lissner Foundation (2nd Prize), and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (National Semifinalist, 1st place New England Region), and is a recipient of Wolf Trap Opera’s Shouse Career Grant.

Corinne earned a Master of Music degree in vocal performance from the Peabody Conservatory and Bachelor of Science degree _magna cum laude_ from Towson University before appearing as a resident artist at the prestigious Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia.

As a master teacher and career mentor, Corinne enjoys sharing her passion for the craft with organizations such as Opera di Roma’s Fabbrica Young Artist Program, YoungArts Miami, Premiere Opera Foundation, National Student Opera Society UK, The University of Arizona, and her alma maters Towson University and the Peabody Conservatory, as well as her private voice studio.
