His first solo orchestral recording as an Exclusive EMI artist, Jonathan Lemalu: Opera Arias won a coveted ECHO Classics Award, New Zealand’s “Best Classical Album 2005” and international praise.

The Amazon editorial wrote: 

*His voice is absolutely even over a huge range. Its velvety warmth enfolds ear and heart, and he can change its colour, inflection and expression in an instant. His breath control is incredible and lets him spin endless legato phrases. The program, ranging from Mozart to Wagner and encompassing four languages, which Lemalu handles with equal mastery, displays his versatility as well as his uncanny ability to establish and portray different characters.*

On the concert platform, Jonathan’s diverse operatic and symphonic repertoire ranges from Mozart, Mahler and Berlioz to Britten, Gershwin and John Adams.

His association with the London Symphony Orchestra began in 2001 and includes Brander/*La Damnation de Faust*, Hobson/*Peter Grimes* (LSO Live) and Hector/*Les Troyens* with Sir Colin Davis in London and New York, and Mr Flint/*Billy Budd* with Daniel Harding (Virgin Classics). This recording won the Grammy for “Best Opera Recording 2009-10”.

Since making his debut at the BBC First Night of the Proms in 2001 in Vaughan Williams’ *Serenade to Music* while still a student at the Royal College of Music in London, Jonathan Lemalu is a regular performer at the prestigious Albert Hall Festival, including Handel’s *Saul* with Paul McCreesh, Haydn’s *Creation* and Beethoven’s *Fantasia* with Sir Roger Norrington, Opera Arias with Sir Mark Elder, De Falla’s *Master Peter’s Puppet Show* with Alexander Briger, Hector/*Les Troyens* with Sir Colin Davis, and Mahler’s *Des Knaben Wunderhorn* with James Judd and his native New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the orchestra’s first ever BBC Prom, and most recently, Walton’s *Belshazzar’s Feast* with Tadaaki Otaka.  In 2004, as a result of singing the role of King in *Les Troyens* and *Saul*, a rarity in itself to sing two proms in the same season, the Evening Standard featured Jonathan, hailing him as “The New King of the Proms”.

Jonathan’s Berlin Philharmonic debut came in 2003 with Charles Dutoit as Brander/La Damnation de Faust with Jonas Kaufmann and Sir Willard White. He was subsequently invited by Maestro Dutoit to sing the role with the Tonhalle Orchestra, Chicago Symphony and Toronto Symphony, as well as Frère Laurence in Berlioz’ *Roméo et Juliette* with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Walt Disney Hall, and Mahler’s 8th Symphony in Beijing and Tokyo. He has also sung Nettuno/*Idomeneo* with Sir Simon Rattle at the Salzburg Festival, and Rodomonte/*Orlando Paladino* with Nikolaus Harnoncourt at the Philharmonie with the Berlin Philharmonic. Other recent concert highlights include John Adams *El Nĩno* in St Louis and San Francisco, John Adams *A Flowering Tree* in Tokyo and Paris, Gershwin’s *Porgy and Bess* suite in Amsterdam and Gstaad, Handel’s *Messiah* in Vienna, New York, Rotterdam and Melbourne, Tippett’s *A Child of our Time* and Mendelssohn’s *Le songe d’une nuit d’été* in Paris, Berlioz’ L’enfance du Christ in London and Mahler’s Des Knaben Wunderhorn in Malaysia, Holland, New Zealand and London.

As a lieder singer and recitalist, Jonathan Lemalu came to international prominence as inaugural winner of the Llangollen International Singer of the Year Award (2000), Concert FM’s Broadcasting Artist of the Year (2000), Royal Overseas League Gold Medal winner (2001). Royal College of Music Tagore Gold Medal Winner (2002), joint winner of the Kathleen Ferrier Award (2002), ECHO (European Concert Hall Organisation) Rising Stars Series Artist (2003-04) and BBC3 Radio New Generation Artist (2002-04). While still at college, he recorded his debut recital disc with Roger Vignoles for EMI Classics. This recording won the prestigious Gramophone Award for “Best Debut Artist”, ECHO Classics Award in Germany, and the Royal Philharmonic Society’s “Debut Artist of Year” presented to him by Dame Joan Sutherland.
