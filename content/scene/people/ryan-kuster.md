Bass-baritone Ryan Kuster has been acclaimed for his “full and rich voice” (Dallas Observor), a “commanding stage presence” (Arts Knoxville) and is “at the beginning of an important career” (Opera Warhorses). He has most recently appeared as the Old Hebrew in _Samson et Dalila_ and the Doctor in _La traviata_ with The Dallas Opera, Theseus in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ with Virginia Opera, Pan in the workshop performance of _The Tree of Eternal Youth_ with American Lyric Theater, and as the Bass Soloist in Beethoven’s _Missa Solemnis_ with Marywood University.

Upcoming performances this season consist of his return to Opera Colorado with his debut of the title role in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and also his return to Virginia Opera to sing Carl Olsen in _Street Scene_.  
  
Mr. Kuster is also recognized for his portrayal of Escamillo in _Carmen_ with Florida Grand Opera, Opera Colorado, Virginia Opera, Opera Grand Rapids, Knoxville Opera and Arizona Opera. _Opera Today_ wrote that “Ryan Kuster gave a strong impression as the handsome and charismatic celebrity, Escamillo. The difficult tessitura of the Toreador Song seemed easy for him as he sang it to his fans at Lillas Pastia’s Tavern.” Colorado's Daily Camera wrote, “Baritone Ryan Kuster possesses a swaggering virility in the role of Escamillo.... The character has the most famous of all the opera's many great tunes, and Kuster's delivery does not disappoint.” He has also performed _La Tragédie of Carmen_ with San Diego Opera.

Recent highlights include Lysiart in von Weber's _Euryanthe_ with Bard Summerscape where the _NY Observer_ said, “They were all fine, in particular Ryan Kuster, smoothly malevolent as the vicious Lysiart. His lithe bass-baritone never hardened even in the most frenzied outbursts, and the dark, noble timbre of the voice made his deception seem all the more plausible.” He also received notable mention for his rendition of the title role in Opera Memphis' _Don Giovanni_. “Ryan Kuster’s well-voiced Don  
Giovanni was charming, arrogant and thoroughly disgusting. Kuster presented a psychologically fascinating character, in love only for as long as he needed to be, supremely confident, unafraid, unencumbered by regrets, witty and quick-witted enough to escape a multitude of compromising situations.” (_The Commercial Appeal_)

Mr. Kuster’s other operatic performances include of Masetto in _Don Giovanni_ with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (directed by Christopher Alden, with costumes by Rodarte, and led by Maestro Gustavo Dudamel), Arizona Opera and Cincinnati Opera; Angelotti in Tosca with Dallas Opera, Pacific Symphony,  
Madison Opera, Orlando Philharmonic and Annapolis Opera; the Mandarin in _Turandot_ with Dallas Opera; Alidoro in _La Cenerentola_ with Opera Saratoga and Nashville Opera; Colline in _La bohème_ with Arizona Opera and Charleston Opera; Sam in _Trouble in Tahiti_ with Opera Santa Barbara; Don Basilio in Marco  
Portugal’s _Marriage of Figaro_ with On Site Opera; and Marullo in _Rigoletto_ with San Antonio Opera.

On the concert stage, Mr. Kuster has performed the Messiah with the Milwaukee Symphony; Bach’s _St. Matthew Passion_ with Boulder Philharmonic; Brutamonte in Schubert’s hidden gem, _Fierrabras_, for the Bard Music Festival; Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the National Symphony Orchestra (debut) and North State Symphony; Fauré’s _Requiem_ with the Bucks County Symphony; the Mozart _Requiem_ with the Neumann College Choir; the title role of Händel’s oratorio _Saul_ with the Marsh Chapel Choir and Collegium; and Adam in Haydn’s _The Creation_ with the Boston University Symphonic Chorus. He also appeared as a featured soloist with Dallas Opera’s Institute for Women Conductors, North State Symphony, Jacksonville Symphony, Ocean City Pops, New Jersey Master Chorale, and Concert Operetta Theater of Philadelphia.

In 2011 and 2012 Kuster was a member of the prestigious Adler Fellowship Program with San Francisco Opera, where he gained vast attention and accolades on the west coast for his 59 mainstage performances in 2 fall seasons. At San Francisco Opera he performed Masetto (Leporello cover) in _Don Giovanni_, Escamillo in SFO's _Carmen_ for Families, Mozart's _Requiem_, Astolfo in _Lucrezia Borgia_, the Mandarin in _Turandot_, Angelotti/Jailer in _Tosca_, 4th Noble in _Lohengrin_, and Count  
Ceprano in _Rigoletto_. Mr. Kuster is also on the DVD release of SFO's production of _Lucrezia Borgia_ with Renée Fleming. His relationship with San Francisco Opera began when he joined the Merola Program, where he appeared as Garibaldo in _Rodelinda_, Don Bartolo in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_, and Dr. Cajus in _Die Lustigen Weiber von Windsor_ in the Schwabacher Scenes Program.

Mr. Kuster has been very successful on the competition circuit, recently being awarded 1st place for the Igor Gorin Award. He also sung on the Metropolitan Opera stage as a National Council Semi-Finalist, received a 3rd place prize in the Gerda Lissner International Vocal Competition, received a Grant from the Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation Competition, the Harmon Award from Chautauqua Opera, and was given the Encouragement Award in the Philadelphia region of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

including the Governor in the world première of Margaret Garwood’s The Scarlet Letter, Schaunard in La  
bohème, Enrico in Anna Bolena, Dikoj in Kát’a Kabanová, and Don Alfonso in Così fan tutte. Mr. Kuster
