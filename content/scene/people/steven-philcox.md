Pianist, Steven Philcox, is Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto where he leads the Collaborative Piano Program. One of Canada's finest collaborators, he is a frequent partner of Canada's vocal elite and continues to perform in leading concert halls across North America. From 1999-2010, Mr. Philcox was répétiteur, assistant conductor, and orchestral continuo player with the Canadian Opera Company where he had the privilege of working on more than 35 productions. Increasingly recognized for his teaching, Mr. Philcox has given masterclasses throughout Canada and is regularly invited to mentor young artists at many of Canada's prestigious summer programs: Opera on the Avalon, Toronto Summer Music, and Vancouver International Song Institute (VISI). He has also held teaching positions at the Banff Center’s Twentieth Century Opera and Song Festival, the Chautauqua Summer Institute, the Center for Operatic Studies in Italy (COSI), and the Highlands Opera Studio in Haliburton, Ontario. Mr. Philcox' most recent endeavor is the Canadian Art Song Project (CASP) which he co-directs with tenor, Lawrence Wiliford. CASP's mission is to foster the development of new song through an annual commission and its performance as well as providing opportunities for Canadian artists to program and advocate the wealth of riches in the existing song literature. A graduate of the University of British Columbia, Mr. Philcox pursued his love of vocal literature for two summers at the Music Academy of the West, Santa Barbara, California. Subsequently, he went on to receive his Master of Music Degree in Vocal Accompanying from the Manhattan School of Music.
