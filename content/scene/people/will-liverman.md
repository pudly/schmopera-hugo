Called “a voice for this historic moment” (_The Washington Post_), baritone Will Liverman continues to bring his compelling performances to audiences nationwide. He will star in the Metropolitan Opera’s reopening production of Terence Blanchard’s _Fire Shut Up in My Bones_ in fall 2021, in addition to reprising his roles in _Akhnaten_ (Horemhab) and _The Magic Flute_ (Papageno) during the Met’s 2021-2022 season.

Following a summer at Opera Theatre of St. Louis and Aspen Music Festival, additional highlights of Will’s 2021-2022 season include the reprisal of _Fire Shut Up in My Bones_ with Lyric Opera of Chicago, Florence Price’s _Song to the Dark Virgin_ with Chicago Sinfonietta, Jonathan Dove’s _Flight_ with The Dallas Opera, and Leonard Bernstein’s _Mass_ as part of a 50th Anniversary Celebration at The Kennedy Center.

In February 2021, Cedille Records released Will’s _Dreams of a New Day: Songs by Black Composers_ with pianist Paul Sanchez – a collection of works by Damien Sneed, Henry Burleigh, H. Leslie Adams, Robert Owens, Margaret Bonds, and Thomas Kerr, plus a world premiere recording by Shawn E. Okpebholo and Will’s own arrangement of Richard Fariña’s _Birmingham Sunday_. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Traditional Classical chart and _The New Yorker_ praised its “clarity, sensitivity, and barely contained heartbreak” while NPR claimed “velvet-voiced baritone Will Liverman is out to make the classical music canon more inclusive”. His album _Whither Must I Wander_ with pianist Jonathan King, out January 2020 on Odradek Records, was named one of the _Chicago Tribune_’s “best classical recordings of 2020” and _BBC Music Magazine_ praised Will’s “firm, oaky baritone with a sharp interpretive attitude… admirable poise and clarity of intention.”

Will’s recent engagements include performing as the first ever Black Papageno in The Metropolitan Opera’s holiday production of _The Magic Flute_, in addition to its premiere of Philip Glass’ _Akhnaten_ (Horemhab) and Nico Muhly’s _Marnie_ (Malcolm Fleet).

His new opera _The Factotum_, written together with DJ/recording artist K. Rico, was workshopped by the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Ryan Opera Center in winter 2020. _The Factotum_, inspired by Rossini’s _The Barber of Seville_, takes place in a present-day Black barbershop in Chicago and combines operatic singing with hip-hop, barbershop, gospel, funk, neo soul, and R&B music.

Will Liverman has performed the leading role of Figaro in Rossini’s _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ with Seattle Opera, Virginia Opera, Kentucky Opera, Madison Opera and Utah Opera. He originated the role of Dizzy Gillespie in _Charlie Parker’s Yardbird_ with Opera Philadelphia, in addition to performing the role with English National Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Madison Opera, and at the Apollo Theater.
