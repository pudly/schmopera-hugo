Called “a voice for this historic moment” (_The Washington Post_), baritone Will Liverman continues to bring his compelling performances to audiences nationwide. He will star in the Metropolitan Opera’s reopening production of Terence Blanchard’s _Fire Shut Up in My Bones_ in fall 2021, in addition to reprising his roles in _Akhnaten_ (Horemhab) and _The Magic Flute_ (Papageno) during the Met’s 2021-2022 season.

Following a summer at Opera Theatre of St. Louis and Aspen Music Festival, additional highlights of Will’s 2021-2022 season include the reprisal of _Fire Shut Up in My Bones_ with Lyric Opera of Chicago, Florence Price’s _Song to the Dark Virgin_ with Chicago Sinfonietta, Jonathan Dove’s _Flight_ with The Dallas Opera, and Leonard Bernstein’s _Mass_ as part of a 50th Anniversary Celebration at The Kennedy Center.

In February 2021, Cedille Records released Will’s _Dreams of a New Day: Songs by Black Composers_ with pianist Paul Sanchez – a collection of works by Damien Sneed, Henry Burleigh, H. Leslie Adams, Robert Owens, Margaret Bonds, and Thomas Kerr, plus a world premiere recording by Shawn E. Okpebholo and Will’s own arrangement of Richard Fariña’s _Birmingham Sunday_. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Traditional Classical chart and _The New Yorker_ praised its “clarity, sensitivity, and barely contained heartbreak” while NPR claimed “velvet-voiced baritone Will Liverman is out to make the classical music canon more inclusive”. His album _Whither Must I Wander_ with pianist Jonathan King, out January 2020 on Odradek Records, was named one of the _Chicago Tribune_’s “best classical recordings of 2020” and _BBC Music Magazine_ praised Will’s “firm, oaky baritone with a sharp interpretive attitude… admirable poise and clarity of intention.”

Will’s recent engagements include performing as the first ever Black Papageno in The Metropolitan Opera’s holiday production of _The Magic Flute_, in addition to its premiere of Philip Glass’ _Akhnaten_ (Horemhab) and Nico Muhly’s _Marnie_ (Malcolm Fleet).

His new opera _The Factotum_, written together with DJ/recording artist K. Rico, was workshopped by the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Ryan Opera Center in winter 2020. _The Factotum_, inspired by Rossini’s _The Barber of Seville_, takes place in a present-day Black barbershop in Chicago and combines operatic singing with hip-hop, barbershop, gospel, funk, neo soul, and R&B music.

Will Liverman has performed the leading role of Figaro in Rossini’s _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ with Seattle Opera, Virginia Opera, Kentucky Opera, Madison Opera and Utah Opera. He originated the role of Dizzy Gillespie in _Charlie Parker’s Yardbird_ with Opera Philadelphia, in addition to performing the role with English National Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Madison Opera, and at the Apollo Theater.

He was also recently featured in the Sphinx Virtuosi concert at Carnegie Hall, in addition to appearing in Schubert’s _Die Winterreise_ at The Barns at Wolf Trap.
