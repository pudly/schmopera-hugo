Bass-baritone Tom Corbeil garners attention regularly across North America for his vocal presence and stagecraft.  Engagements for the 2013-2014 included his return to the Canadian Opera Company for both Colline in La bohème and Swallow in Peter Grimes and debuts with Nashville Opera as Basilio in Il barbiere di Siviglia, Hobart Baroque in Australia as Zoroastro in Handel’s Orlando, and UrbanArias as Luciano/Chucho in Bastianello & Lucrezia with UrbanArias. This season includes Count Horn/Samuel in Un ballo in maschera with Austin Lyric Opera.

The 2012-2013 season brought his Michigan Opera Theater debut as Basilio in Il barbiere di Siviglia, his return to Florida Grand Opera for Rodolfo in La sonnambula, and Leporello in Don Giovanni with the Green Mountain Opera Festival.  For the 2011-12 season, Mr. Corbeil delved into the realm of musical theatre, performing Lurch with the first national tour of The Addams Family Musical.  In the 2010-11 season, he was seen as Leporello in Don Giovanni with Florida Grand Opera, Colline in La bohème with Eugene Opera, and the English Clerk in Death in Venice with the Canadian Opera Company, as well as performing in Beethoven’s Missa solemnis with the La Jolla Symphony and Chorus.  In recent years, Tom sang Basilio in Le nozze di Figaro with Florida Grand Opera, Faraone in Mosè in Egitto with Chicago Opera Theater, and Leporello in the Fort Worth Opera production of Don Giovanni. Previously, he made his New York debut with Gotham Chamber Opera singing the role of Enrico in Haydn’s L’isola disabitata, a performance for which he was praised for his “robust, manly bass-baritone and physical prowess.” He also received plaudits for his interpretation of Colline in La bohème with both Opera Omaha and Sacramento Opera. The summer of 2009 saw a return to the Santa Fe Opera for Mr. Corbeil, where he performed as the Marquis in La traviata and the Oracle and Infernal God in Gluck’s Alceste.

As a member of the Merola Opera Center at San Francisco Opera, Mr. Corbeil created the role of Tom Carter in the world premiere of Thomas Pasatieri’s The Hotel Casablanca.  During his tenure in the studio at Florida Grand Opera, he performed as Colline in La bohème, Angelotti in Tosca, and Curio in Giulio Cesare.  Other recent engagements include Superintendent Budd in Albert Herring and Crespel in Les Contes d’Hoffmann at Opera North, the Imperial Commissioner in Madama Butterfly and a matinée performance of Mustafá in L’italiana in Algeri at Palm Beach Opera, and Zuniga in The Tragedy of Carmen at Opera Omaha.  Additional roles include Figaro in Le nozze di Figaro, Sprecher in Die Zauberflöte, Caronte in Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo, and Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore.

A two-time regional finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, Mr. Corbeil has also received multiple prizes from the Liederkranz Foundation and the Musical Merit Foundation competitions. For his work as an apprentice at Santa Fe Opera, he received the Agnes M. Canning Memorial Award in 2008. He is also a grant recipient from the Opera Buffs Foundation of Los Angeles.  He received training in the young artist programs of Santa Fe Opera, Florida Grand Opera, San Francisco’s Merola Opera Program, Palm Beach Opera, and Opera North.
