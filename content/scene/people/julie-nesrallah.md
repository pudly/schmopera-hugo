Mezzo-soprano, Julie Nesrallah is a singer, actress and broadcaster who dazzles audiences with her engaging personality, and her rich and deeply expressive voice. Miss Nesrallah is regularly engaged by leading opera companies, symphonies, festivals and chamber music ensembles across North America and around the world.

In the winter of 2014, Miss Nesrallah was awarded the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal for her cultural contribution to Canada as a singer and as the host of CBC Radio 2’s national classical music program, *Tempo*. Miss Nesrallah has been the recipient of several distinguished prizes and awards, including the Canada Council for the Arts Emerging Artist Award & Mid-Career Grant.

On July 1, 2011 Miss Nesrallah sang *God Save the Queen* for His Royal Highness Prince William and Her Royal Highness Princess Kate during Canada Day festivities in Ottawa on Parliament Hill in a performance that was viewed by millions of people around the world. She has also performed An Evening for Peace in Montreal for Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan and for Princess Haya in Amman, Jordan.

Miss Nesrallah is the Executive Producer and star of Carmen on Tap, a rogue opera company she created that performs Georges Bizet’s opera *Carmen* as dinner theatre. This season, Carmen on Tap debuts at the Stratford Music Festival, Lula Lounge in Toronto, and with the Prince Edward County Music Festival in the fall.
