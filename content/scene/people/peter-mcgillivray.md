Originally from Saskatchewan, baritone Peter McGillivray has recently relocated to Toronto after a decade living in Northern Ontario. He has been described in the national press as “a gifted comic actor,” with a “rich, flexible and strong voice.” In recent seasons he has been seen on opera and concert stages from coast to coast, specializing in comic roles such as Dr. Bartolo in _Barber of Seville_, Don Magnifico in _La Cenerentola_, Bottom in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_, Sir Joseph Porter in _HMS Pinafore_ and Stubb in _Moby Dick_. He also excels in interpreting more dramatic fare such as Sharpless in _Madama Butterfly_, Don Pizarro in _Fidelio_ and concert performances of Handel’s Messiah, Mahler’s “Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen,” Haydn’s _Creation_, Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_ and Orff’s _Carmina Burana_.

He has performed lead roles with the Canadian Opera Company as well as opera companies in Dallas, Victoria, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Manitoba, Hamilton, Ottawa and Quebec City. Additionally, he spent the 2010-11 season on the roster of the Metropolitan Opera in New York in productions of _La Bohème_ and Strauss’ _Capriccio_. His recent and upcoming seasons include appearances with Manitoba Opera, Vancouver Opera, his reprise of the role Bassest in Rocking Horse Winner with Tapestry Opera, and, his return to Pacific Opera Victoria as Bartolo in _Le nozze di Figaro_.

McGillivray first leapt to international attention in 2005 by winning top prizes at both the Montreal International Musical Competition and the Queen Sonja Competition in Oslo, Norway. He was previously the winner of the 2003 CBC/Radio-Canada Young Performers Competition and is an alumnus of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio program. Since then he has appeared with many prestigious ensembles in concert, among them, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Orchestra symphonique de Québec, Royal Liverpool, Oslo and Calgary Philharmonics, and symphony orchestras in Victoria, Vancouver, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, Hamilton, Windsor and Montreal.

He is particularly proud of his longstanding association with Tapestry Opera having created several roles for productions including Morris Panych and James Rolfe’s _The Overcoat_, Omar Daniel’s _The Shadow_, Juliet Palmer’s _Shelter_ and Gareth Williams’ _Rocking Horse Winner_. Along with the Gryphon Trio and Elmer Iseler Singers, he is a featured soloist on the 2017 JUNO-nominated recording of Andrew Staniland’s _Dark Star Requiem_. His discography also includes Summer Schemes, an album with pianist Liz Upchurch that the Toronto Star called, “a rich art-song tapestry of summer-themed enchantments,” as well as a more recent 2016 Centrediscs release, _Cloud Light_: The Songs of Norbert Palej.
