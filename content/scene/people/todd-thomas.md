Recognized by opera companies and critics alike as one of the true Verdi baritones gracing stages today, Todd Thomas continues his tenure as one of America’s most sought-after artists. In the title role of *Macbeth*, *Opera News* depicted his performance as “warm and centered in his tone with subtle phrasing that emphasized the introspective, almost poetic quality of the tormented king.”

At Lyric Opera of Chicago’s season opening performance of Verdi’s *Otello*, Mr. Thomas heroically stepped in for an indisposed colleague at the top of the second act. The thrilling performance at The Lyric “earned him deservedly the largest ovation at the end of the night from the glittery opening night audience.” (The Chicago Classical) 

Next, Mr. Thomas will make his Opera Shanghai debut as the title role in Wagner’s *Der fliegende Holländer*, return to Opera Omaha as Tonio/Alvio in *I Pagliacci* *Cavalleria Rusticana*, perform Scarpia in *Tosca* with New Jersey Festival Orchestra, and perform in Opera Santa Barbara’s Gala Concert. This past summer, he returned to Theater Erfurt in a ground-breaking production of *Der fliegende Holländer* and sang the title role of *Falstaff* with the Crested Butte Festival, in addition to his role there as Artist in Residence.

More recently, engagements have included returns to the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Monterone in *Rigoletto*, the title role of Verdi’s *Falstaff* with Manitoba Opera, Sharpless in *Madama Butterfly* and Renato in *Un Ballo in Maschera* with Florida Grand Opera, title role in Rigoletto with Atlanta Opera, Scarpia in *Tosca* and Rolando in *La Battaglia di Legnano* with Sarasota Opera, Germont in *La traviata* with Des Moines Metro Opera, Alberich in *Das Rheingold* with Pacific Opera Victoria in Canada, and Iago in *Otello* with Arizona Opera.

Mr. Thomas’ made his Metropolitan Opera début as Dr. Metivier in *War and Peace* and subsequently returned for productions of *Roméo et Juliette*. Other engagements have included Count di Luna in *Il trovatore* and *Falstaff* with the Seattle Opera; title role in *Rigoletto* at Michigan Opera Theatre, Opera Birmingham, Manitoba Opera, Palm Beach Opera, Atlanta Opera, and Austin Lyric Opera; Scarpia in
*Tosca* at New York City Opera, Florida Grand Opera, Opera Lyra Ottawa, Michigan Opera Theatre, Florentine Opera of Milwaukee, Orlando Philharmonic, and Opera Carolina; the title role in *Falstaff* with Opera Santa Barbara; Tonio/Alfio in *Pagliacci/Cavalleria Rusticana* with Arizona Opera and Opera Omaha; Count di Luna in *Il trovatore* at the Manitoba Opera and Indianapolis Opera; Sharpless
in *Madama Butterfly* with Opera Carolina, Opera Omaha, and Florida Grand Opera; and Amonasro in *Aïda* with Opera Carolina and North Carolina Opera.


Mr. Thomas remains a house favorite for several opera companies, appearing season after season. For Nashville Opera, he has appeared in two productions of *Pagliacci* as Tonio, as Amonasro in *Aïda*, as Rigoletto, and in *Amahl and the Night Visitors*, *L’enfant et les sortilèges*, and *The Lighthouse* (Davies). With Des Moines Metro Opera, performances have included Germont in *La traviata*, King Melchior in *Amahl and the Night Visitors*, Captain Balstrode in *Peter Grimes*, Rigoletto, Macbeth, Iago in *Otello*, and Renato in *Un ballo in maschera*.

With the Chautauqua Opera: Miller in *Luisa Miller*, Enrico in *Lucia di Lammermoor*, Count di Luna in *Il trovatore*, Sharpless in *Madama Butterfly*, and Scarpia in *Tosca*, and the title roles of Falstaff, Nabucco, and Macbeth.

Mr. Thomas also appeared in more than 50 performances with the Sarasota Opera including Jack Rance in La fanciulla del West, Ezio in Attilla, Enrico in *Lucia di Lammermoor*, Scarpia in *Tosca*, and the title roles of *Falstaff*, *Nabucco*, and *Macbeth*.

Of a recent Falstaff performance, Opera News said, “Thomas's forthright vocalism (featuring wonderful top notes) and apt physique give him a leg up in this part, but he also captured the generous, earthy spirit of Shakespeare’s creation, giving the evening its comic and emotional fulcrum...it’s hard to imagine there are many better Falstaffs working on North American stages today.”

In concert, Mr. Thomas’ most recent engagements include Leoni’s *L’oracolo* and Montemezzi’s *L’incantesimo* with Teatro Grattacielo at Avery Fisher Hall; his Carnegie Hall début in Duruflé’s *Requiem* and Mark Hayes’ *Te Deum* and Spirit Suite followed by returns for Händel’s *Messiah* and Mozart’s *Coronation Mass*. He enjoyed great success in the world premières and subsequent performances as the baritone soloist in Bob Aldridge’s *Parables* with the Topeka Symphony. He also sang Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the Evansville Philharmonic and numerous pops concerts with the Ocean City Pops Orchestra. Recital dates have included appearances on the various concert series of Elmira College, Grand Rapids Art Museum, Wednesday Music Club Series of Harrisburg PA, and the Glenridge Series of Sarasota.
 
He also sang a solo recital entitled “If Music be the Food of Love” in Winnipeg, Manitoba as part of a fundraising event for the Community Ministries of The
Westminster Church of Winnipeg.

Early in his career, Mr. Thomas was a member of the MusikTheater Ensemble for Stadttheater Giessen. During his years in Europe, he was a guest artist in Basel, Switzerland, and Heidelberg, Germany, and made his début with Macedonia Opera as Amonasro in *Aïda*. Mr. Thomas also appeared in Hong Kong, Fiesole, Pisa, Cagnes-sur-Mer, Sarlat, Luzerne, and Utrecht, under the auspices of Stichting Pagliacci of Utrecht University.


Mr. Thomas can be heard on the Naxos recording of Menotti’s *Amahl and the Night Visitors*. He also recorded a solo disc, *Crown Him Lord of All*, with Jon Spong, organist.
