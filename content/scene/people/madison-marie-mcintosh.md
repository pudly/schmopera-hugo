She won The American Prize in Vocal Performance in 2020 and later performed a benefit concert for The American Prize that featured world premieres of works by eight composers. 

Madison has performed Ernesta (_Un avvertimento ai gelosi_) at Caramoor, Deli_a (_Il viaggio a Reims_) with the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Alto Soloist (_Messiah_) with New Amsterdam Opera, and other roles nationally and internationally.
