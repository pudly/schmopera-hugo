Latvian soprano Marina Rebeka is widely regarded as one of the most exceptional artists of our time. Her performances as Violetta in Verdi's *La traviata* are heralded as definitive portrayals of the role, and she is frequently lauded as a leading Rossini and Mozart singer of her generation.

Since her landmark performance at the Salzburg Festival in 2009, under the baton of Riccardo Muti, Marina has been a regular guest at the world's most prestigious concert halls and opera houses, such as the Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall, the Teatro alla Scala, Royal Opera House (Covent Garden), Amsterdam’s Het Concertgebouw, the Bavarian State Opera, Vienna State Opera, and the Zurich Opera House.

She collaborates with leading conductors such as Zubin Mehta, Antonio Pappano, Fabio Luisi, Marco Armiliato, Michele Mariotti, Thomas Hengelbrock, Paolo Carignani, Stéphane Denève, Yves Abel, Ottavio Dantone and Alberto Zedda. Her spectacular array of repertoire spans ranges from jewels of the Baroque era (Handel), Bel Canto masterpieces (Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti), and much loved works by Verdi (*La Traviata*), Tchaikowsky (*Eugene Onegin*), and Stravinsky (*The Rake’s Progress*).

Ms. Rebeka is also active on the recital and concert stage, having performed at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, the “Rudolfinum” Concert Hall in Prague, the Rosenblatt Recital series in London, Teatro alla Scala, and the Großes Festspielhaus Salzburg. She has shared the stage with venerated ensembles including the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra Teatro Comunale di Bologna, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Filarmonici della Scala. She recorded Rossini’s *Petite messe solennelle* for EMI (Warner Classics) with the Orchestra of Santa Cecilia in Rome, led by Sir Antonio Pappano. Her first solo CD titled “Mozart Arias” was also released by the label in November 2013.
