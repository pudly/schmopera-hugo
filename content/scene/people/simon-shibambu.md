Rising bass Simon Shibambu recently graduated from the Royal College of Music,
and in 2017 enters his second season as a member of the Jette Parker Young Artists
Programme at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Born in Johannesburg, South
Africa, Shibambu studied vocal arts at Tshwane University of Technology and vocal
performance at the RCM with Graeme Broadbent, as an Association Board of the
Royal Schools of Music scholar supported by the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust and
Minerva Trust. In competition, he won first prize in the Amazwi Omzansi Africa Opera
Singing Competition, first prize and audience prize at the Clonter Opera Competition,
and an International Opera Awards Bursary.

The 2017/18 season brings a host of new roles for Shibambu at the Royal Opera

In August 2016, Shibambu participated in the prestigious Young Singers Project at the
Salzburg Festival, where he was featured as Naval Captain in Puccini *Manon Lescaut*
alongside Anna Netrebko and conducted by Marco Armiliato, and as Palémon in
Massenet *Thaïs*, sharing the stage with Plácido Domingo. As a young artist with the

Previous highlights include King of Scotland in Handel *Ariodante* for the London
