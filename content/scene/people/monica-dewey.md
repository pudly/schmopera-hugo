Recognized for her endearing timbre and indelible warmth and beauty, Monica Dewey is a soprano from Atlanta, Georgia. She started her career with the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis in 2017 as Servilia in _La Clemenza di Tito_. Since then, she has made several notable house debuts, including the San Francisco Opera, Michigan Opera Theatre, and Oper Köln, while performing additional recitals at Opera America and the Kerrytown Concert House. 

In the 2020 - 2021 season, Monica was scheduled to make her stage debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of the Unborn in _Die Frau Ohne Schatten_. She was also scheduled to join the roster of the Chicago Lyric Opera in their production of George Benjamin’s _Lessons in Love and Violence_. As opera companies resume their seasons in a post-COVID world, Monica will join Opera Theatre of St. Louis in the _New Works, Bold Voices Lab_ as part of their 2021 Outdoor Festival Season followed by the International Meistersinger Akademie (IMA) in Neumarkt, Germany. 

In the 2019 - 2020 season, Monica joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera in their productions of _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and Agrippina. Previously scheduled engagements included a house debut with Intermountain Opera Bozeman to sing Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_. In the past few seasons, Monica has been seen in an impressive variety of repertoire. In 2018, she made a house debut with Oper Köln as Second Niece in _Peter Grimes_ and performed Alexandra in Regina at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis alongside operatic legends Susan Graham and Jim Morris. She has also championed works by Ricky Ian Gordon both on the operatic stage and in recital. At the Michigan Opera Theatre, she performed the role of Alice B. Toklas in _27_ and was praised by Opera News for her “mastery of musical styles ranging from contemporary opera to musical theater and cabaret... Dewey’s endearing timbre burst with warmth.” In recital with Kathleen Kelly, she performed Gordon’s chamber piece _Orpheus and Euridice_, based on the death of Gordon’s long-time life partner. Other important debuts include Pousette in _Manon_ with the San Francisco Opera, Gilda in _Rigoletto_ with the Sacramento Philharmonic and return engagements to Michigan Opera Theatre as Cunegonde in _Candide_ and the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as Susanna in _The Marriage of Figaro_. 

In 2017, Monica was awarded 1st Prize, Prize of the Sponsors, Prize of the Media, and Prize of the Jury at the 10th International Hilde Zadek Competition at the Musikverein in Vienna, Austria. Her other honors include top prizes from the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (National Semi-Finalist) and the Sullivan Foundation. Additional grants have been awarded by the Gerda Lissner Foundation, the American Prize, and the Georgina Joshi Foundation. Monica received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Kentucky in Music and Arts Administration and a Master of Music from Indiana University. While at Indiana University, Monica was awarded the Georgina Joshi International Fellowship and worked as an Associate Instructor of Voice. 

Monica is an advocate for women’s rights and a proud member of the LGBT+ community. Recent panel discussions include “Discovering Labor and Identity in Opera” with Sing for Solidarity and the Representation and Responsibility Panel at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, titled “#Timesup, #MeToo, & Women in Opera”. Monica lives in New York City with her partner, Synthia.
