While pursuing a Sales & Marketing degree at Tuskegee University Ms. Adeeb realized that singing in the university choir would not sustain her love for performing after graduation. Her path led her to Louisiana State University where she began classical training and continued on to Binghamton University in New York for her Master’s degree. Two of her favorite roles performed are Violetta in _La traviata_ and Mimì in L_a bohème,_ both under the baton of Maestro Vlad Iftinka at Tri-Cities Opera. Another favorite has been singing the role of Clara in Po_rgy and Bess u_nder the baton of Maestro John Demain and the direction of Francesca Zambello at the Glimmerglass Festival.

Some other roles that Ms. Adeeb has performed include Nannetta in _Falstaff_, Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_, Gilda in _Rigoletto_, and Bard 2 in Ben Moore’s opera _Odyssey_. In addition to performing operatic roles, Ms. Adeeb has enjoyed competing in vocal competitions, winning 3rd place in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions, and 2nd place in the Deborah Voigt/Vero Beach Opera Foundation Inaugural International Vocal Competition.

Other notable performances include the title role in Puccini’s _Suor Angelica_ at Tri-Cities Opera, Annie in the world premiere of _The Flood_ at Opera Columbus, Frasquita in _Carmen_ with Annapolis Opera, Clara in _Porgy and Bess_ with both Fort Worth Opera and Teatro Regio di Torino, and Galatea in _Acis and Galatea_ in a virtual co-production with Annapolis Opera and Tri-Cities Opera.
