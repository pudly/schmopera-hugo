Ian Page  is the founder, conductor and artistic director of Classical Opera. He began his musical education as a chorister at Westminster Abbey, and studied English Literature at the University of York before completing his studies at the Royal Academy of Music in London. At the start of his career he worked on the music staff at Scottish Opera, Opera Factory, Drottningholm and Glyndebourne, working with such conductors as Sir Alexander Gibson, Nicholas McGegan, Mark Wigglesworth, Ivor Bolton and Sir Charles Mackerras.

With Classical Opera he has conducted most of Mozart’s early operas, including the world premieres of the ‘original’ version of *Mitridate, re di Ponto* and a new completion of *Zaide*, as well as *Le nozze di Figaro*, *Così fan tutte* and *La clemenza di Tito*. He has also conducted the UK premieres of Gluck’s *La clemenza di Tito* and Telemann’s *Orpheus*, and the first new staging for 250 years of Johann Christian Bach’s *Adriano in Siria*. In 2009 he made his Royal Opera House debut conducting Arne’s *Artaxerxes* at the Linbury Studio Theatre, and his studio recording of the work was released in 2011 on Linn Records.

He also devised and conducted Classical Opera’s recordings of ‘The A-Z of Mozart Opera’ (Signum Classics) and ‘Blessed Spirit – a Gluck retrospective’ (Wigmore Hall Live), both of which were selected for Gramophone magazine’s annual Critic’s Choice, and he recently embarked on a new complete cycle of Mozart opera recordings with Classical Opera.
