Hailed by the New York Times as a soprano of "gleaming sound, free and easy high notes, agile coloratura runs and lyrical grace," Jessica Pratt is considered one of today's foremost interpreters of some of bel canto's most challenging repertoire.

Since her European debut in 2007 as Lucia di Lammermoor Ms. Pratt's schedule has included performances at opera theatres and festivals such as the Teatro alla Scala of Milan, Zurich Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Vienna State Opera and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, working with conductors such as Daniel Oren, Nello Santi, Kent Nagano, Sir Colin Davis, Christian Thielemann, Donato Renzetti, Pier Giorgio Morandi, Carlo Rizzi, Antonino Fogliani, Wayne Marshall and David Parry.
