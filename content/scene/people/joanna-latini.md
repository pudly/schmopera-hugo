Soprano Joanna Latini, a New Jersey native, is quickly making a name for herself for her informed and passionate performances. Opera News hailed Ms. Latini “a generous performer \[with\] winning personality and a sound both luscious and supple, exuding charm\[.\]” Her professional experience ranges from Baroque opera to contemporary new works and musical theatre. In 2018, she was named a National Semi-Finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

 For Ms. Latini, the 2019-2020 season brings numerous company and role debuts, beginning with her Canadian debut as Musetta in _La bohème_ with Calgary Opera. She returns to the concert stage in her debut with Ars Lyrica Houston for their “Handel in Love” program, and then reprises the role of Rosina in _The Ghosts of Versailles_ for her European debut at the Chateau de Versailles Spectacles in France. In the spring, Ms. Latini adds two bel canto heroines to her repertoire as Adina in _L’elisir d’amore_ with Permian Basin Opera and Gilda in _Rigoletto_ with Resonance Works Pittsburgh. In the summer of 2020, she makes her role and company debut with the Berkshire Opera Festival as Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_.
