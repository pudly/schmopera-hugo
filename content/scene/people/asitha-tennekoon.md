Praised by _The Globe and Mail_ for “...his silky, emotional presence on stage – both vocally and dramatically...”, Sri Lankan tenor Asitha Tennekoon has established himself as one of Canada’s most versatile singing artists. He drew critical acclaim as Paul in Tapestry Opera/Scottish Opera’s _Rocking Horse Winner_, receiving the 2016 Dora Award for Best Male Performance. Sought after for performances spanning from Baroque to new commissions and experimental music, Asitha enjoys exploring the many ways opera and art music can make an impact on audiences today. This season, Asitha sings his first Remendado in Pacific Opera Victoria’s _Carmen_, followed by the role of Boy Angel in the Canadian Premiere of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize­winning opera _Angel’s Bone_ (Du Yun, Royce Vavrek), co­produced by re:Naissance Opera, Sound the Alarm Music/Theatre, Arraymusic, Loose Tea Music Theatre and Turning Point Ensemble. In 2023, Asitha debuts as Flute in Britten’s _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ with Vancouver Opera, Jacques Lacombe conducting. 

On the concert stage, Asitha will be the tenor soloist in _Messiah_ with Vancouver Bach Choir and is a featured soloist in "Music for The Winter Solstice", presented by Music on Main, also in Vancouver. In May he joins pianist Leslie Dala for "Songs of Desire", a song recital presented by Müzewest featuring the premiere of a new song cycle by Métis composer Ian Cusson, based on the poetry of Michael Ondaatje. A Dora Award­winning performer, Asitha most recently made his debut as Ferrando in Edmonton Opera’s _Cosi fan tutte_, the First Priest with Canadian Opera Company’s _The Magic Flute_, and Bénédict in Opera Kelowna’s production of Berlioz’ _Béatrice et Bénédict_. Asitha has sung principle roles with Opéra de Montréal, Against the Grain Theatre, Tapestry Opera, Soundstreams Canada, Opera on the Avalon, Opera 5, and Opera Lafayette (USA). Asitha is a Co­Founder of Amplified Opera, an indie Opera company committed to placing artists at the centre of public discourse. He makes his home in the unceded traditional territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil­Waututh) Nations (Vancouver, BC).
