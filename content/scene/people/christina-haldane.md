Christina enjoys an active performing career in the UK, Europe, Asia and North America. Recent highlights includ a return to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, to sing Fiorilla (cover) in Rossini’s *Il Turco in Italia* and Nella (cover) in Puccini’s *Gianni Schicchi*, a performance of Mercedes in Bizet’s *Carmen* for the Cambridge Philharmonic, as well as sell out recitals for Handel House London and the Oxford Lieder Festival.

In Jan 2012 she made her mainland European stage debut, singing Cleopatra to Franco Fagioli’s *Caesar*, in Finnish National Opera’s daring new production of Handel’s *Julius Caesar*. This success was quickly followed by a performance with the Capella Cracoviensis and Maestro Alessandro de Marchi, of Handel’s *Solomon* in Krakow.

She reprised her interpretation of Clorinda in Rossini’s *La Cenerentola* at Iford Arts’ magical Italianate cloister, a role in which she previously made her debut with Scottish Opera. On the concert stage, her Viennese Programme with the Brighton Philharmonic was described as “superb”. The 2013 season also saw her return to her native Canada, to celebrate her Acadian roots by performing a French song recital for the 51st Festival Acadien. Christina joined the Britten centenary celebrations in 2014 by returning to the Cambridge Philharmonic to sing the role of Second Niece in *Peter Grimes*. She is dedicated to performing contemporary music and was delighted to contribute to the workshops for Mark Anthony Turnage and Richard Thomas’ new opera *Anna Nicole* at the Royal Opera House.

For the Royal Opera House she has performed Rapunzel in Sondheim’s *Into the Woods* and gave the London premier of Jonathan Dove’s *Minterne* at the ROH Crush Room. She has also performed the title role in Donizetti’s *La fille du régiment* for Swansea City Opera, the title role in Janáček’s *Cunning Little Vixen* for the Oundle International Festival and Fox in *Cunning Little Vixen* for Longborough Festival Opera, and Coryphée & Sidonie in Gluck’s *Armide* for Buxton Festival Opera and Pamina in Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte* for the Cambridge Philharmonic.

Other roles in Christina’s repertoire include Musetta in Puccini’s *La bohème*, the title role in Handel’s *Alcina* and Anna Page in Nicolai’s *The Merry Wives of Windsor*. Christina’s concert performances include Handel *Messiah*, Bach *St John Passion*, *St Matthew Passion* and *Jachzet Gott in allen Landen*, Mozart *Requiem*, *Coronation Mass* and *Exsultate jubilate*, Rossini *Petite Messe Solennelle*, Haydn *Nelson Mass*, Pergolesi *Stabat Mater*, DeLalande *Confitibur tibi* and Mendelssohn *Hymn of Praise*. When studying in Indiana she collaborated with Lukas Foss on his *Time Cycle* and her performance was hailed as “a triumph”.

She has participated in several summer training programmes, including the Chautauqua Institution with Marlena Malas, the Lake Placid Institute with Phyllis Bryn-Julson, the Britten – Pears Young Artist Programme in Aldeburgh and the Académie Internationale d’été de Nice with Robin Bowman.
