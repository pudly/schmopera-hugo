Wes Mason grew up in Norfolk, Virginia performing music and theater on school and community stages. Playing guitar and singing in rock and folk bands lead him to study classical voice and eventually to a career in opera. He has been fortunate to work with Anne Bogart, Christine Brewer, Jake Heggie, Jack O’Brien, Terrence McNally, Francesca Zambello, and many others. His favorite roles have included Billy Bigelow in *Carousel*, Curly in *Oklahoma!*, Stanley Kowalski in *A Streetcar Named Desire*, Father Flynn in *Doubt*, the title roles in *Eugene Onegin*, *Hamlet*, and *William Tell*, as well as Reinaldo Arenas in the world premiere of *Before Night Falls*. He’s a graduate of the Academy of Vocal Arts and the University of Michigan where he was presented the Earl V. Moore Award for outstanding contribution to the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance. Recently, he studied at the William Esper Studio under Suzanne Esper for their summer intensive. He is currently based in Brooklyn, New York.
