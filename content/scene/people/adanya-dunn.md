Canadian-Bulgarian lyric mezzo-soprano Adanya Dunn was named by the CBC as one of Canada’s “Top 30 Hot Classical Musicians Under 30” and was featured in _The Globe & Mail_ as one of six Canadian women who are “turning opera on its head and making the future bright for the art form”.

A versatile performer, her 2019/20 season included highlights Mozart’s _Così fan tutte_ as Dorabella with the Bergen Symphony Orkest, Berio’s _Sequenza III_ at Belgium’s Festival 20/21 with the New European Ensemble, and various concerts in Amsterdam’s Dutch National Opera and Het Concertgebouw.

In the upcoming 2020/21 season, Adanya debuts at the Muziekgebouw with an opening recital performance in the Grote Zangers series and in a solo recital in Muziekgebouw’s Canal House series; a concert tour of the Netherlands with Irish pianist Seán Morgan-Rooney, showcasing popular and art music styles through original compositions and arrangements; and performs the role of Octavian in Strauss’ _Der Rosenkavalier_.

Adanya debuted at Carnegie Hall in 2015, is a prize winner from the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, and is a three-time grant recipient from the Canada Council for the Arts. She is an alumna of Dawn Upshaw’s Vocal Arts Program, Marilyn Horne’s Music Academy of West, the Rebanks Family Fellowship & International Residency at the Glenn Gould School, and the University of Toronto.

Born and raised in Toronto, she was a resident performer with the interdisciplinary arts collective FAWN Chamber Creative and was the Co-Founder of the innovative chamber music series The Happenstancers. Adanya performed with companies such as Against the Grain Theatre, Soundstreams, the Luminato Festival, Tapestry Opera, and the Canadian Music Centre. Her consistent collaboration with composers, librettists, and collectives, has led her to premiere over 200 works.

Adanya’s diverse musical interests has led her to pursue making music with the sound healing meditation group Leyline Tides, the poly-genre electronic project #operEMIX, and in the leading role as Artistic Director of Rosebud Opera: Queering the Opera Narrative.
