World renowned Mezzo-soprano Alice Coote is regarded as one of the great artists of our day.

Equally famed on the great operatic stages as in concert and recital she has been named the ‘superlative British Mezzo’ (San Francisco Chronicle). Her performances have been described as ‘breathtaking in \[its\] sheer conviction and subtlety of perception’ (The Times) and her voice as ‘beautiful, to be sure, but, more importantly, it thrills you to the marrow.’ (The Daily Telegraph).

Renowned on the great recital, concert and opera stages of the world, Alice Coote’s career has taken her from her beginnings in the north of England (born in Cheshire), singing in local festivals and playing oboe in the Cheshire Youth Orchestra, to being regarded as one of the great artists of today.

Most recently, she has debuted Schubert’s Winterreise at ‘’The Stars of the White Nights’’ Mariinsky Festival in St Petersburg where she returns this year to perform Schumann’s Frauenliebe und Leben and Dichterliebe.
