On the international stages of opera, concert, and recital, Canadian John Tessier has garnered attention and praise for the beauty and honesty of his voice, for a refined style and creative versatility, and for his handsome, youthful presence in the lyric tenor repertoire.  The Juno Award-winning artist has worked with many of the most notable conductors of our day including David Robertson, Leonard Slatkin, Plácido Domingo, John Nelson, Franz Welser-Möst, Emmanuelle Haïm, Charles Dutoit, Donald Runnicles, Robert Spano, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, and Bernard Labadie. 

In the 2017-18 operatic season, Mr. Tessier returns for a fourth consecutive year to the stage of the Wiener Staatsoper and, this time, reprises his acclaimed portrayal of Tonio in Laurent Pelly’s production of *La fille du Régiment*.

On the concert stage appearances include *Messiah* with the Colorado Symphony, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with Rune Bergmann and the Calgary Philharmonic and with the National Arts Centre Orchestra conducted by Alexander Shelly, as well as concert performances of Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte* and Requiem with Krzysztof Urbański and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. 

Last season John Tessier made a role debut as Massenet’s *Werther* in a new production at Manitoba Opera, appeared at the Wiener Staatsoper in *La fille du Régiment*, and bowed at Edmonton Opera in a revival of *La cenerentola*. He also joined Kent Nagano and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra for semi-staged performances of Bernstein’s *A Quiet Place*, which were recorded for future commercial release on Decca. 

Highlights of recent opera seasons include Bellini’s *I Puritani* conducted by Marco Armiliato and Count Almaviva in Rossini’s *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, both at the Wiener Staatsoper; Cherubini’s *Médée* at the Théâtre des Champs-Élyséesconducted by Christophe Rousset; both *Les pêcheurs de perles* and Maria Stuardaled by Carlo Montanaro at Seattle Opera and *La cenerentola* for New Zealand Opera. He has given the world première of Robin de Raaff’s *Waiting for Miss Monroe* at the Netherlands Opera, and has sung *Der fliegende Holländer* under the baton of Jeffrey Tate at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He appeared in *Don Giovanni* for a South American debut at the Teatro Colón with conductor John Neschling, and in *The Pearl Fishers* with the English National Opera. 

Further operatic credits include *Salome* at the Verbier Festival led by Valery Gergiev, *La cenerentola* and *Così fan tutte* at Minnesota Opera, *Don Giovanni* and *Hamlet* at Washington National Opera, *Lakmé* with L’Opéra de Montréal, and a new Jonathan Miller production of *The Elixir of Love* at both English National Opera and the New York City Opera. Conte Almaviva in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* has featured prominently in the tenor’s career with performances at English National Opera, New York City Opera, Edmonton Opera, Austin Lyric Opera, L’Opéra de Québec, and in a new Leon Major production at Glimmerglass Opera.
