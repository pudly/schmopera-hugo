Praised for his "rich, powerful voice" and "bravura-filled stage presence," Neal Ferreira is a promising lyric tenor with a handsome, masculine tone quality to which he brings a cultivated vocalism and eloquent expression. Dubbed a “Boston mainstay” by the Boston Globe, he most recently appeared with Boston Lyric Opera as a member of the Jazz Trio in Bernstein’s **_Trouble in Tahiti_**, and with the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra as Le Remendado in **_Carmen_**.

This October, Ferreira created the role of Master Turner in the world premiere of **_Brother Nat_**, a new opera based on Nat Turner’s historic slave insurrection of 1831, with book/lyrics by Jabari Asim and Liana Asim and music by Allyssa Jones. Upcoming engagements include his role debut as Tamino in **_The Magic Flute_** with the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra at Symphony Hall in March 2019, as well as his first performance of the tenor solos in Beethoven’s **_Symphony No. 9_** with the Wellesley Symphony Orchestra in May 2019. In June 2019 he will return to Emmanuel Music to sing the role of Captain Macheath in Benjamin Britten's version of **_The Beggar's Opera_**.

Mr. Ferreira made his Tanglewood debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the summer of 2018 in a concert performance of **_La bohème_** under the baton of Maestro Andris Nelsons. He first performed with the BSO in the 2016-17 season as Ein Tierhändler in **_Der Rosenkavalier_** with Renée Fleming and Susan Graham. He made his Odyssey Opera debut later that season as Jack in Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco’s **_The Importance of Being Earnest_**, and he has since returned to the Odyssey stage singing the role of Giovanni D’Aire in Donizetti’s rarely heard **_L’assedio di Calais_**.

A much sought after interpreter of new music, Ferreira’s successful performance as the Visitor in Boston Lyric Opera’s production of Philip Glass’ **_In the Penal Colony_** was called “poignant” by the Wall Street Journal and “perfect” by Opera News. He originated the role of Ferdinand in the world premiere of Joseph’s Summer’s **_The Tempest_** with the Shakespeare Concerts in 2015, and he can be heard on the original cast recording released on Albany Records. He is also featured on the premiere recording of James MacMillan’s chamber opera, **_Clemency_**.

The tenor received the 2013 Artist of the Year Award from Syracuse Opera, where he last performed the role of Alfred in **_Die Fledermaus_** to much acclaim. He was also awarded the 2009 Stephen Shrestinian Award for Excellence from Boston Lyric Opera, with whom he has performed numerous roles over the last ten seasons, including Tancredi in John Musto's **_The Inspector_**, Monostatos in **_The Magic Flute_**, the Gran Sacerdote in Mozart’s **_Idomeneo, re di Creta_**, and Snout in **_A Midsummer Night's Dream_**, to name a few.

Mr. Ferreira made his Opera Colorado debut performing Spalanzani and Andres in **_Les Contes d’Hoffmann_**, roles he first performed with Boston Lyric Opera under the direction of Maestro Keith Lockhart and reprised with the Florida Grand Opera. Other appearances have included Sheldon Segal in **_Later the Same Evening_** and Charlie Davenport (cover) in **_Annie Get Your Gun_**with Deborah Voigt at the Glimmerglass Festival.

As an oratorio soloist, Mr. Ferreira has performed the role of Uriel in Haydn’s **_The Creation_** with soprano Jayne West, as well as noted performances in Orff’s **_Carmina Burana_**, Bach’s **_Mass in B minor_** and **_Magnificat_**, Mozart’s **_Requiem_**, Rossini’s **_Petite Messe Solennelle_**, and Dvořak’s **_Stabat Mater_** throughout the New England area. He is a regular guest soloist at his alma mater, Providence College, where he most recently appeared in Handel’s **_Messiah_** and Dubois’ **_Seven Last Words of Christ_** with the Providence College Orchestra and Chorus.

Mr. Ferreira is a student of the world-renowned tenor, Frank Lopardo. He holds a Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance from New England Conservatory, graduating with Academic Honors in 2005. There he studied with international opera singer Patricia Craig, and he sang the role of Tamino in **_The Magic Flute_** as part of New England Conservatory Outreach Opera’s inaugural production.

As a recipient of the Roberts Music Scholarship for musical aptitude and achievement, Mr. Ferreira completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in Music from Providence College in 2002, graduating cum laude. While at Providence College, he studied voice with David Harper and appeared in many stage productions with both the Music and Theater Departments. Mr. Ferreira has returned several times as a guest artist to perform in recital as well as teach masterclasses to undergraduate students.
