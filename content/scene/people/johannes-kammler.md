Concerts as a soloist with the Berliner Philharmoniker, the London Symphony Orchestra or the Orquesta Sinfónica Simon Bolívar de Venezuela under conductors such as Sir Simon Rattle, Gustavo Dudamel, Sir Mark Elder and Marin Alsop have taken him to London, Berlin, Hamburg and Baden-Baden , Porto, Moscow, Caracas and Los Angeles.

Future assignments include more recitals with Roger Vignoles at Wigmore Hall, Schloss Elmau and De Doelen Rotterdam, his role debuts eg in BARBIERE, ARABELLA, TOTENHAUS, CARMEN and LES VÊSPRES SICILIENNES at the Bavarian State Opera, and his debut in the summer of 2018 with the opera THE PROCESS of Gottfried von Einem at the Salzburg Festival.
