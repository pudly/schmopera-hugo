Young dramatic soprano Naomi Eberhard, known for her round, steely voice is quickly establishing herself in the music of Verdi, Puccini and the Germanic repertoire. Her unique sound is recognized for its agility, power, nuance and thrilling upper register.

This coming season will see Ms. Eberhard take on Bellini's *Norma* in addition to concert series' highlighting Verdi and Shakespeare and Ottawa’s summer festival: Music and Beyond. In the 2014/2015 season she focused on the repertoire in which she excels as she took on the title role in Verdi’s *Luisa Miller* with Toronto based Opera by Request. Highlights from 2013-2014 include *Carmen*’s Frasquita with the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, Musetta in *La Bohème* with Opera by Request and Euridice with The Annex Singers. In the 2012-2013 season Ms. Eberhard premiered with Calgary Concert Opera in the role of Giorgetta in Puccini’s masterpiece *Il tabarro* followed by *Così fan tutte*'s Fiordiligi with Opera by Request. 

*Die Zauberflöte*’s Erste Dame brought her to Opera on the Avalon in St. John’s, Newfoundland in June 2013. In Summer 2012, Ms. Eberhard travelled to Sulmona, Italy to prepare the roles of La Contessa and Marcellina in *Le Nozze di Figaro*. She was recently seen in the role of Erste Dame from *Die Zauberflöte* with the Toronto Summer Opera Workshop and making her debut with Opera by Request as Helmwige in *Die Walküre*. Recently performing with Opera on the Avalon in the excerpted roles of Die Marschallin from Richard Stauss’ *Der Rosenkavalier*, Fiordiligi from *Così fan tutte*, Tatyana from Eugene Onegin and Miss Pinkerton from Menotti’s *The Old Maid and the Thief*, Ms. Eberhard is identifying with the repertoire that suits her best. In July of 2011 she had the opportunity to perform excerpts of Wagner’s *Lohengrin* playing Elsa with the St. Andrew’s Emerging Artist Program.

No stranger to concert work, Ms. Eberhard has performed as a soloist numerous times with both Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and the Windsor Symphony Orchestra. She was seen in the role of Nella in *Gianni Schicchi* with her master’s alma mater UBC along with cover and scene work including Alice Ford in Verdi’s *Falstaff*, Fiordiligi in *Così fan tutte*, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni* and Erste Dame in *Die Zauberflöte*.
