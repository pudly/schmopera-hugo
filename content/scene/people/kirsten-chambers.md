Kirsten Chambers made her Metropolitan Opera house debut on short notice in 2016 in the title role of _Salome_.  Her Carnegie Hall debut came on just two days’ notice when she sang the fiendishly difficult role of Maria in Richard Strauss’ _Friedenstag_ with the American Symphony Orchestra.  Her 2016-17 season started when she joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera for the first time this fall as a cover of Isolde in _Tristan und Isolde_.  

The 2015-16 season she debuted Rusalka at Lyric Opera of Kansas City and Leonore in _Fidelio_ for the grand opening of New Amsterdam Opera.  For her performance at the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, she “sang convincingly as the beautiful, conniving Foreign Princess, without sacrificing great vocal sounds for characterization.” (The Examiner) 

Her 2014-15 season began with her exciting debut in the title role of _Salome_ at Opera Hong Kong, where “the depth of her performance grew widely as she exhibited the fitness of an athlete… The dramatic colour exhibited throughout her middle range and the defined delicacy of her high notes easy won the audience over.” (Opera Chaser)  For Opéra de Rennes, she reprised the role of Elsa in _Lohengrin_, described as “delicious with beautiful legato and radiant high notes.” (Opéra Magazine)

er 2013-14 season began with her European debut with Savonlinna Opera Festival as Elsa in _Lohengrin_, with regard to her performance, Opera Magazine indicated that “Kirsten Chambers… wielded the evening's most convincing dramatic arc, her character maturing from innocent young girl to emotionally complex woman in the course of the story.“  She also appeared as a featured soloist in excerpts from _Lohengrin_ with the Oulu Symphony in both Oulu and Helsinki and later at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in St Petersburg in promotional concerts for Savonlinna Opera Festival.  Ms. Chambers reprised the role of Elsa in _Lohengrin_ for the Hong Kong Arts Festival.  In concert she performed Isolde’s Liebestod from _Tristan und Isolde_ with the Hong Kong Philharmonic and Brünnhilde’s Entrance from _Die Walküre_ with Orchestra Kentucky.

Ms. Chambers 2011-12 season began with a cover of the title role of _Turandot_ with Arizona Opera and a concert performance of the title role of _Tosca_ with Opera Saratoga.  She made her Lincoln Center debut starring in the soprano monodrama Nora, in the Great Outdoors with American Opera Projects.   She has appeared with Toledo Opera to cover the title role in _Ariadne of Naxos_ and sang Nedda in _Pagliacci_ with the Bronx Opera.  A champion of new music, Ms. Chambers has been recored on the Newport Classics Label and appeared numerous times with American Lyric Theater and American Opera Projects.
