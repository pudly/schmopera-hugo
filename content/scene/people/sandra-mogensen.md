Sandra Mogensen is equally at home performing as a solo pianist, working with singers in recital, and as vocal coach. She has performed in Canada, the United States, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, and Austria.

Since 2006, Sandra has specialized in the music of Edvard Grieg, and has recorded three albums of Grieg piano music on the Chestnut Hall Music label. A double album of two more recordings (Volumes 4 & 5) is planned for 2015, as well as a recording of Grieg songs with Norwegian soprano, Hilde Haraldsen Sveen. Ms. Mogensen endeavours to help increase awareness of Scandinavian repertoire to singers, pianists, and audiences outside of Scandinavia, and offers coaching in Norwegian and Danish in addition to her work with French, German, English, and Italian. Her specialties and interests also include 20th and 21st century opera, operatic and oratorio recitative, and recital repertoire and planning. A versatile musician, Sandra has extensive experience with opera, art song, chamber music, musical theatre, sacred and choral repertoire.

Sandra was awarded grants from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Canada, the Association for the Advancement of Scandinavian Studies in Canada, and the Ontario Arts Council, for a 2014 research trip in to study Norwegian diction and Grieg’s songs for voice and piano. In January 2015 she adjudicated and performed at the International Grieg Conference in Sarasota, Florida. Further research on Scandinavian vocal repertoire continues through participation at the International Grieg Song Workshop and Conference in Bergen, Norway, and research in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Sandra studied at the University of Western Ontario with Dr. Damjana Bratuz, and in Salzburg, Austria, and Copenhagen, Denmark, and at Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey, where she received a Master’s of Music in Vocal Coaching and Accompanying, studying with J.J.Penna and Dalton Baldwin. Ms. Mogensen has many years of experience working with many different voice teachers, and is fascinated by how each pedagogue brings their own 'piece' of this miraculous puzzle which is vocal technique.

Singers Sandra has performed with in concert include Brett Polegato, James Westman, Gary Relyea, Danielle Buonaiuto, Torin Chiles, Catherine & Mark Gardner, Roger Honeywell, Mellissa Hughes, Eliza Johnson, Keith Lam, Christopher Mayell, Deb Overes, Drew Santini, Danielle Talamantes, Anna Tam Relyea, Michael York, and Todd Wieczorek.

Ms. Mogensen is currently based in Stratford, Ontario, and works as a coach in Toronto, Stratford, and Copenhagen.
