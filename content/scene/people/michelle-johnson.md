Soprano Michelle Johnson, a Grand Prize Winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions where she was described as “a clear audience favorite” (New York Times), has been lavished with praise for her “extraordinary breath control and flawless articulation… Her voice is velvety and pliant – a dulcet dream.” Recent engagements include Ms. Johnson’s house and role debut with Chicago Opera Theater as Zemfira in _Aleko_, a featured soloist performance with Madison Symphony Orchestra, a debut with Waterbury Symphony for their Holiday Pops and a return to Chautauqua to perform Strauss’ _Vier letzte Lieder_ with Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra. During the 2020-2021 season, Ms. Johnson was slated to make her Allentown Symphony, Florentine Opera, Opera on the James and Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia debuts (COVID19). Instead, she joined Opera Tampa as Leonora in _Il trovatore_, and Opera Delaware for a concert of Shakespeare selections.

A favorite of many houses, Ms. Johnson made recent returns to Lyric Fest for “I Hear America Singing”, Sarasota Opera as Madame Lidoine in Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites, and Boston Landmark Orchestra as a soloist in Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9.  Ms. Johnson has also made a name for herself as one of the most in demand Aidas in the opera world today, performing Verdi’s tragic heroine with Glimmerglass Music Festival, Opera Santa Barbara, Opera Columbus, Knoxville Opera, Opera Idaho, and Sarasota Opera, among others.  Ms. Johnson’s debut with Columbus Symphony as soprano soloist in Verdi’s Requiem was highly praised, and her collaboration with Madison Opera as Santuzza in their most recent production of _Cavalleria Rusticana_ was given rave reviews.

Past opera credits include Leonora in _Il trovatore_ most recently with Hawaii Opera Theatre, Minnie in _La Fanciulla del West_ with Kentucky Opera, Élisabeth de Valois in _Don Carlos_ with Sarasota Opera, the title role in _Manon Lescaut_ and Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_ with Opera Philadelphia, and Mimi in _La bohème_ with both Annapolis Opera and PortOpera.  Her concert and solo credits include the soprano solo in Verdi’s _Requiem_ and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with Orquesta Sinfónica del Principado de Asturias, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with Boston Philharmonic, an all-French Opera concert with Maestro Michel Plasson in Montpellier, France, the soprano soloist in Vaughan Williams’ _Dona nobis pacem_ with Juneau Symphony, and an all Verdi concert with The Princeton Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Rossen Milanov. Adept in non-standard repertoire as well, Miss Johnson performed the title role in the rarely performed _Sakuntala_ with Teatro Grattacielo along with numerous other contemporary works.

A graduate of the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, Boston University Opera Institute, and New England Conservatory, Ms. Johnson was seen as the title role in _Suor Angelica_, Leonora in _Oberto_, Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_, the Countess in _Capriccio_, and Alice Ford in Falstaff during her educational tenure.
