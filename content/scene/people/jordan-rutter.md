New York City-based countertenor Jordan Rutter enjoys a young career embracing opera, concert repertoire, and contemporary work. Highlights of his operatic activity include Oberon in *A Midsummer Night's Dream* with Opera on the Avalon, the Sorceress in *Dido and Aeneas* with the Hawaii Performing Arts Festival, and creating the role of Le fils de Macduff in the American French-language premiere of Ernest Bloch's *Macbeth*, a performance which earned Mr. Rutter praise from both Opera News and Gay City News.

Mr. Rutter’s oratorio credits include Pergolesi’s *Stabat Mater*, Handel’s *Messiah*, Mozart’s *Requiem* and Bernstein’s *Chichester Psalms*. He has also performed the cantatas for alto solo Bach BWV 35 Geist und Seele wird verwirret and Haydn’s *Arianna a Naxos*.

Dedicated to the development and performance of new music, Mr. Rutter has recorded Australian composer Rebecca Erin Smith’s *Draw | Pull | Drag* for countertenor and cello in a collaboration between Manhattan School of Music and Columbia University, and has created the role of Lola in American Opera Projects’ staging of Joseph Rubinstein’s *Legendary*.

During the 2015–2016 season, Mr. Rutter joins Classic Lyric Arts and the enCANTA collective to perform scenes from *Serse*, *Rinaldo*, and *Orphée et Eurydice*, collaborates with Met LiveArts in Mingwei Lee's Sonic Blossom, and performs the world premiere of Edgar David Grana's chamber cantata *Lay By*. He also returns to American Opera Projects to participate in the development and creation of Robert Paterson's chamber opera triptych *Three Way*. Mr. Rutter will develop and create the role of Kyle in the triptych's final opera *Masquerade*, beginning with an American Opera Projects workshop performance in May 2016, continuing to the *Three Way* world premiere with Nashville Opera in January 2017, and culminating in *Three Way*'s New York premiere at Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in June 2017.

Mr. Rutter holds degrees from the Manhattan School of Music and University of North Florida.
