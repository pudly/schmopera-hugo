"Vocally and physically agile, bright voiced and moving" (*The New York Times*), Grammy Award-winning baritone Daniel Belcher has been hailed by London’s The Guardian as "possessing the kind of stuff that indicates a star in the making." With a repertoire of more than 65 roles, Belcher has championed roles from the Baroque to those written expressly for him. He has performed with opera houses around the world including San Francisco Opera, Houston Grand Opera, New York City Opera, Opera Philadelphia, Dutch National Opera, Holland Festival, Théâtre du Châtelet, Staatsoper Stuttgart, Grand Théâtre de Genève, Barbican Centre, ABAO-OLBE Bilbao, Opéra de Montpellier, Opéra Royal de Versailles, Stockholm’s Baltic Sea Festival, Berlin’s Maerzmusik Festival, St. Gallen Festspiele, Saito Kinen Festival, Tokyo’s New National Theatre, Seoul National Arts Center, and many other international and North American venues.
 
Engagements for last season included the world premiere of Lori Laitman’s *The Scarlet Letter* for Opera Colorado, Lully’s *Armide* at the Royal Opéra de Versailles and Toronto’s Opera Atelier, *The Mikado* for Chautauqua Opera, and Count Danilo in *The Merry Widow* for the Utah Opera. In the 2016-2017 season, he sings Ping in *Turandot* with Opera Philadelphia as well as Inspector Kildare in the workshop of Kevin Puts' *Elizabeth Cree* with the company. Additionally, he makes his debut with Michigan Opera Theater as Father Palmer in *Silent Night*, returns to Lyric Opera of Kansas City as Owen Hart in *Dead Man Walking* and Utah Opera as Brain Castner in *The Long Walk*, and debuts with Atlanta Opera as Ping in *Turandot*. Future world and American premieres in development include Ricky Ian Gordon’s *The House without a Christmas Tree* and Thomas Morse’s *Frau Schindler*.
