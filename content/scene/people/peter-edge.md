Opera roles include Aeneas in Purcell’s _Dido and Aeneas_ (Ryedale Festival), Alfio in Mascagni’s _Cavalleria Rusticana_ (Blackburn Cathedral), Antonio in Mozart’s _Le Nozze di Figaro_ (RCM, directed by Sir Thomas Allen), Don Alfonso in Mozart’s _Cosi Fan Tutte_ (Devon Opera and Opera at the Athenaeum, Pall Mall), Figaro in Mozart’s _Le Nozze di Figaro_ (Opera North: Whistle Stop Opera),  Guglielmo in Mozart’s _Cosi Fan Tutte_ (Felici Opera) and Marcello in Puccini’s _La Boheme_ (Hampstead Garden Opera). Peter is looking forward to performing as Escamillo in Opera Loki’s French touring production of Bizet’s _Carmen_ in Summer/Autumn 2020 and Leporello in Opera at the Athenaeum’s production of Mozart’s _Don Giovanni_, also in Autumn 2020.  

At the beginning of December 2019 Peter made his solo debut at the Royal Albert Hall, where he sang at the Grand Final of the ATP Champions Tennis Tour. Peter also enjoys choral singing and joined the Sixteen in 2019 for the world premiere and CD recording of James MacMillan’s Symphony No. 5, _Le grand inconnu_.
