Award winning soprano Whitney Mather is recognized for her considerable poise and expressivity and continues to shine in both opera and art song repertoires. Ms. Mather also enjoys the challenge of working in new music and is thrilled to be a part of the indie opera scene in Toronto. 

Most recently, Ms. Mather spent the month of June in Los Angeles, CA at Songfest in masterclasses with Roger Vignoles, Margo Garrett, Alan Smith, John Musto, Martin Katz and Libby Larsen. In July, she has the honour of being one of the vocal Fellows for the Toronto Summer Music Festival.  In May, she was cast in the role of Rosina in Saskatoon Opera in School’s production of *The Barber of Seville* and was announced in March as the 2016 winner of the Toronto Mozart Vocal Competition. In December, she performed in Against the Grain’s Dora Award nominated *Messiah* and performed the roles of Queen of the Night and First Lady in *The Magic Flute* in a tour to Stratford and PEI in the summer of 2015. This season, Ms. Mather will attend the University of Toronto to complete her Master’s degree in Vocal Performance, studying with Monica Whicher, and will sing the role of Cupid in Opera Atelier’s spring 2017 production of Charpentier’s *Medée*.
