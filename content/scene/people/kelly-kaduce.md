	Kelly Kaduce is a soprano with a warm and rich voice, stunning beauty, and superb acting ability. For her creation of the title role in <em>Anna Karenina</em>, <em>Opera News</em> proclaimed her "an exceptional actress whose performance was as finely modulated dramatically as it was musically... and her dark, focused sound was lusty and lyrical one moment, tender and floating the next." For her Boston Lyric Opera debut in the title role of <em>Thaïs</em>, <em>Opera News</em> observed, "Kaduce sings with bell-like purity and silvery sweetness, and she suspends her legato with an effortless, sensual spin. A born actress, Kaduce is also a masterful illuminator of text."
