Lauded by The Guardian for her "dark and focused" voice, "sensational coloratura" and "spectacular singing" and by The Times for her "fierce, indeed terrifying, cane-swishing" characterisations, Beth Taylor is one of today's most electrifying young mezzo-sopranos.

In the 2024-25 season, Beth makes her debut in the title role of _La Cenerentola_ at the Opéra de Nancy, with performances following at the Grand Théâtre of Luxembourg, Théâtre de Caen and Opéra de Reims. Operatic performances on the concert platform include Lisea (_Arsilda_) at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam and Auditorio Nacional Madrid and Cornelia (_Giulio Cesare_) with The English Concert at Carnegie Hall, Barbican Hall and in San Francisco. In concert, Beth also appears in Beethoven's Symphony No 9 with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra at the Baden-Baden Easter Festival; Beethoven's Symphony No 9 and Haydn's _Harmoniemesse_ at the Paris Philharmonie; Harmonienmesse at the Konzerthaus Berlin; Mahler's Symphony No 3 with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, Mahler's _Das Lied von der Erde_ with the Orchestre de Chambre Paris at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris; Alma Mahler's _Fünf Lieder_ with the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal for her Canadian debut in Montréal; Michael Haydn's and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's _Requiem_ with the Handel and Haydn Society for her US debut in Boston; Tippett's _A Child of our Time_ at Glyndebourne; Elgar's _Sea Pictures_ for BBC Now in Aberystwyth and Bangor and in de Falla's _El amor brujo_ with the Tonkünstler Orchester.

Recent performances on the opera stage have included Cornelia and Bradamante (_Alcina_) at Glyndebourne; Arsace (_Semiramide_), La Cieca (_La Gioconda_), Erda (_Das Rheingold_), Erste Norn (_Götterdämmerung_) and Schwertleite (_Die Walküre_) for Deutsche Oper Berlin; Giuliano Gordio (_Eliogabalo_) at the Zurich Opera House; Falliero (_Bianca e Falliero_) and Dardano (_Amadigi di Gaula_) at Oper Frankfurt, Bradamante at the Nancy Opera House as well as staged versions of Mendelssohn's _Elias_ at the Opéra de Lyon and of Bach's _St Matthew's Passion_ at Theater Basel.

On the concert platform, she has appeared as Anna (_Les Troyens_) at the Salzburg Festival, Berlin Festival, BBC Proms and the Berlioz Festival; as Sorceress (_Dido and Aeneas_) at the Teatro Real Madrid, Elbphilharmonie Hamburg, Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, Philharmonie Luxembourg and Philharmonie Essen; as Argia (_La Merope_) at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam; as Ursule (_Béatrice et Bénédict_) at the Berlioz Festival; as Teseo (_Ariana in Creta_) at the London Handel Festival and as Cornelia in Madrid and Basel.

Other concert appearances have included Mahler's Symphony No 2 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall; Mozart's _Requiem_ at the BBC Proms, Paris Philharmonie, Palau de la Music Barcelona and Valencia, Konzerthaus Dortmund, in Versailles, Bordeaux and Lausanne; Mozart's _Krönungsmesse_ at the Concertgebouw, Beethoven's _Missa Solemnis_ and Berlioz's _Roméo et Juliette_ at the Gulbenkian Lisbon, Elgar's _The Dream of Gerontius_ in Dublin, Bach's B Minor Mass in Aix-en-Provence, Versailles, Belgrad and at the Thüringer Bachwochen Festival; Bach's _St Matthew's Passion_ and _St John's Passion_ in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Beth is also a much requested recitalist, having performed with Malcolm Martineau at the Buxton Festival and with Hamish Brown at the Schubertiada in Vilabertran, among others.

The mezzo-soprano has sung under the baton of conductors such as Leonardo Garcia Alarcon, Roland Böer, Giuliano Carella, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Edward Gardner, Alessandro De Marchi, Andrea Marcon, Ingo Metzmacher, John Nelson, Raphaël Pichon, Ivan Repušić, Corrado Rovaris, Sir Donald Runnicles and Constantin Trinks.
