Samoan tenor Pene Pati is a graduate of San Francisco Opera’s Adler Program where, under Music Director Nicola Luisotti, he made an acclaimed 2017 debut as Il Duca di Mantova in Verdi’s _Rigoletto_, and has subsequently been hailed ​‘the most exceptional tenor discovery of the last decade’ (_Opéra-Online_) following his first performances as Percy in Donizetti’s _Anna Bolena_ at Opéra national de Bordeaux in the 2018/2019 season. Subsequent productions of Gounod’s _Roméo et Juliette_ at San Francisco Opera and Opéra national de Bordeaux as well as Alfredo in Verdi’s _La traviata_ at Moscow’s historic Bolshoi Theatre have secured Pati’s position as one of the most sought-after tenors of his day.

In the upcoming season, Pati debuts at Opéra National de Paris (_L’Elisir d’amore_), Teatro San Carlo di Napoli (_Lucia di Lammermoor_), Wiener Staatsoper (_Anna Bolena_), San Diego Opera (_Roméo et Juliette_), Staatsoper Berlin (_La traviata_) and Festival d’Aix-en-Provence (_Moïse et Pharaon_). In concert, he adds Mahler’s _Das Lied von der Erde_ to his repertoire in St Pölten under Hans Graf, joins The Cleveland Orchestra and Franz Welser-Möst in concert performances of _Otello_, and appears at Théâtre des Champs-Elysées as part of Les Grands Voix in Massenet’s _Thaïs_ with l’Orchestre National de France and Pierre Bleuse.

Pene Pati is an exclusive recording artist for Warner Classics. His self-titled debut album of Italian and French arias, recorded with Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine under Emmanuel Villaume, is due for release in March 2022.

In the formative years of his career, Pati enjoyed a string of high-profile competition successes taking the coveted Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge ​‘Bel Canto’ Award (2012), both Second Prize and Audience Prize at Operalia (2015), and Second Prize at Neue Stimmen (2015). As First Prize winner at the Montserrat Caballé International Aria Competition (2014), Pati joined a special celebratory concert to celebrate the life of the late, great soprano at Barcelona’s Gran Teatre del Liceu in 2019, and was part of an all-star line-up of soloists performing at the 2017 Richard Tucker Gala at New York’s Carnegie Hall.

Since 2012, Pene Pati has enjoyed huge commercial success as part of Sol3 Mio, a popular trio formed together with his tenor brother and baritone cousin. Their first album, released on Decca Classics, achieved 8x platinum sales in New Zealand and they continue to perform together to sold-out stadiums whenever solo schedules permit.
