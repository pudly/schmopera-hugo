With a voice described as "a golden thread of sound that can swell without strain to magnificence" (_The Telegraph_), Samoan tenor Pene Pati was awarded the 2025 Opus Klassik Solo Recording of the Year for _Nessun Dorma_, his second release as an exclusive artist for Warner Classics. His latest addition to the catalogue, _Serenata a Napoli_, a specially curated collaboration with Il Pomo d'Oro, promises to be one of the highlights of the 2025-2026 season's releases. 

On stage this season Pene Pati further expands his repertoire with a debut in Offenbach's _Les contes d'Hoffmann_ in a new production by Lydia Steier at Staatsoper Berlin conducted by Bertrand de Billy and he sings Massenet's _Werther_ at Opéra Comique in a new staging by Ted Huffmann, conducted by Raphäel Pichon. Further house debuts include Edgardo (_Lucia di Lammermoor_) at Teatro alla Scala and Tito (_La Clemenza di Tito_) at Opernhaus Zurich. In concert version, he sings Gounod's _Faust_ at Amsterdam's historic Concertgebouw under Stéphane Denève as well as Verdi's _Requiem_ at Teatro San Carlo under Nicola Luisotti and Berlioz's _Requiem_ at Philharmonie de Paris under Philippe Jordan. Pene Pati will also make his North American solo recital debut at New York's prestigious Park Avenue Armory accompanied by Ronny Michael Greenberg.
