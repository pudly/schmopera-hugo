Suzanne Kantorski is one of the most exciting, and versatile vocal performing artists today. She has earned a solid reputation as a sensitive, and heart-rending interpreter of New Music, Contemporary Classical, rare concert works, and Jazz. She has also appeared in leading operatic roles, as a concert soloist with notable companies worldwide… but prefers to work with living composers.

Passionate about site specific performing, in 2016 Suzanne sang the inaugural season premiere of The Vermont Opera Project’s *Orpheus and Euridice* by Ricky Ian Gordon in an abandoned marble production facility, and the Washington National Gallery of Art. The Washington Post praised her performance saying: “Suzanne took on the role of Euridice with grace and generously smooth vocal production!”

Other recent new music projects include: performance art works by ambient composer Tim Hecker at EMPAC, Tierstien’s *A Blessing on the Moon*, which debuted with the Grammy Nominated Warsaw Village Band at Le Poisson Rouge in NYC, Jerusalem’s *Los Maitines de Nuestra Señora de la Concepción*, Lisoy’s Tenderness with The Manhattan Piano Trio, William Mayer’s *A Death in the Family*, Lorentz’s *Sin Palabras*, and Weiss’ *Bridge to Glory*.

In 2014, Suzanne created the principal soprano role of Mary in the recognized Operatic Tableaux, *Oh My Son* by Spanish Composer Marcos Galvany with members of the Washington National Opera Orchestra and Chorus. In June 2015, *Oh My Son* made its second major debut in the U.S. at The Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles. *Oh My Son* continues to tour worldwide to sold out venues across Europe.

In Jazz, Suzanne was a founding musician of the all female jazz ensemble AZULES that toured regularly on the U.S. east coast. Her work frequently caught the attention of Fanfare Magazine, who described her as: “…Reminding one strongly of the pioneer work that Ursula Dudziak... the propulsion and mosaic-like quality one associates with Ornette Coleman… (and the) way shades of Loulie Jean Norman! …Exquisite, and often striking vocals.” 

In film, Suzanne's work on the Independent Short, *Il Destino* directed by Ricardo Correa Berriozabal, has been seen at festivals internationally. She is also the leading actress Mimi in the feature film adaptation *The Bohemians* based on Puccini’s *La Boheme*, directed by Jose Luis Cortes. *The Bohemians* is slated for release in theatres worldwide in 2018.

Currently, Suzanne is also a Visiting Associate Professor of Voice at The Crane School of Music, SUNY Potsdam. She has been regularly featured on nationally syndicated radio programs such as NPR’s “Sound Check” with John Schaefer, WQXR with Brian Wise, and VPR’s “Saturday Afternoon at the Opera” talking about the trained voice, artistic projects, and the direction of vocal artists in the 21st Century.

Quintus 4 combines everything Suzanne loves most about music and performance, and she is beyond excited to share this unique vision for the future of classically based presentations with you. She has also most recently changed her hair to blonde, and is finding it to be, indeed more fun.
