Recognized for her unique artistic curiosity in world-class performances spanning the music of Claudio Monteverdi and Johann Adolph Hasse through to György Ligeti and George Benjamin, American Lauren Snouffer is celebrated as one of the most versatile and respected sopranos on the international stage.

Opera performances of the current season fortify the soprano’s position as one of the eminent interpreters of contemporary music. Lauren Snouffer assays the title role of Berg’s *Lulu* in a new production at the Teatro Municipal de Santiago conducted by Juan Pablo Izquierdo and directed by Mariame Clément and she reprises her acclaimed portrayal of Agnès in George Benjamin’s *Written on Skin* for Opera Philadelphia’s new production. Furthermore, she creates principal soprano roles in the world premieres of Houston Grand Opera’s *The House Without A Christmas Tree*, written by Ricky Ian Gordon in a new production by James Robinson, and in Andrew Norman’s *A Trip to the Moon* presented by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and directed by Yuval Sharon. Equally celebrated in roles of the traditional opera canon, Lauren Snouffer returns to the stage of the Lyric Opera of Chicago in a new production of *Orphée et Eurydice* directed and choreographed by John Neumeier under the baton of Harry Bicket and Mozart heroines include Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni* with Stefano Montanari conducting the Moscow Chamber Orchestra and Pamina in *Die Zauberflöte* with Krzysztof Urbański and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Additional concert performances include Mozart’s *Requiem* with The Cleveland Orchestra and Barber’s *Knoxville: Summer of 1915* and Mahler’s Fourth Symphony with the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra.

A dynamic concert schedule in 2016-17 included Bach’s *Johannes-Passion* with Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra, Mozart’s *Requiem* with Cristian Macelaru and the Rotterdam Philharmonic, Handel’s *Messiah* with Patrick Dupré Quigley and the San Francisco Symphony, and *Carmina Burana* with Krzysztof Urbański and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. No less impressive was her operatic diary which included *Die Zauberflöte* at Seattle Opera, *A Little Night Music* with Des Moines Metro Opera, Handel’s *Arminio* for the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, and *Béatrice et Bénédict* at the Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse.

Highlights of past seasons include Houston Grand Opera performances of *Le nozze di Figaro* conducted by Harry Bicket in a production by Michael Grandage as well as presentations of *Carousel*, *Show Boat*, *The Rape of Lucretia*, and *L’italiana in Algeri*, Lyric Opera of Chicago productions of *Rusalka* and *La clemenza di Tito*, a Seattle Opera debut as La Comtesse Adèle in Rossini’s *Le comte Ory* conducted by Giacomo Sagripanti, *The Magic Flute* at the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, and Max Emanuel Cencic’s new production of Hasse’s *Siroe* at the Opéra Royal de Versailles, with further performances in Budapest and Vienna.

Lauren Snouffer joined Markus Stenz and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra for performances of Beethoven’s *Egmont*, Harry Christophers and the Handel & Haydn Society of Boston in Mozart’s *Requiem*, Franz Welser-Möst and The Cleveland Orchestra for Brahms’ *Ein deutsches Requiem* and concert performances of Strauss’ *Daphne*, and she dazzled as Cunegonde in concert performances of Bernstein’s *Candide* with Marin Alsop and the Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo.

Closely associated with George Benjamin’s *Written on Skin*, she has sung the lead soprano role under the composer’s baton at the Tanglewood Festival of Contemporary Music and with the Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse. She has sung Ligeti’s *Mysteries of the Macabre* with the Aspen Contemporary Ensemble and has given the New York premiere of HK Gruber’s *Gloria – A Pig Tale* with Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic in a production staged by Doug Fitch.

An impactful discography includes Hasse’s *Siroe* and Handel’s *Ottone* with George Petrou for Decca, Gottschalk’s *Requiem for the Living* with Vladimir Lande on Novona Records, Grantham’s *La cancíon desesperada* conducted by Craig Hella Johnson on Harmonia Mundi, and Feldman’s *The Rothko Chapel* with Steven Schick for ECM.

A graduate of the Houston Grand Opera Studio, Lauren Snouffer was a winner of a 2013 Sara Tucker Study Grant from the Richard Tucker Music Foundation, a Richard F. Gold Career Grant bestowed by Houston Grand Opera, a grand finalist in the 2012 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, and was graduated from Rice University and The Juilliard School.
