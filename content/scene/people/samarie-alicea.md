Praised by The New York Times for her "bright-voiced and endearing soprano" Puerto Rican soprano Samarie Alicea is an emerging singing actress gaining recognition.  Samarie recently sang as Aire in *Los Elementos* at the New York's Couture Fashion Week with NYCO & Opera Carolina's Opera Recycles.  This season included her return Off-Broadway reprising the role of Susanna in *Figaro 90210!* and her soloist debut with the New York City Opera as Aire in Antonio de Literes' Los Elementos.  Critics praised her Aire performance as a "soprano like a warm breeze, easily floating, with a consistent caramel tone, and she is irrepressibly sunny presence on the stage".  This season also included the role of Clorinda in *La Cenerentola* as part of NYCO's 2017 Park Series at Bryant Park, New York. 

Critics hailed her Susana performance as "slyly alluring" and as "a very strong actress delivering her entertaining comedy skills".

She has also been part of New York City Opera's last productions of *Aleko* / *Pagliacci* and *Florencia en el Amazonas*.  Samarie performed as Susanna in *Le nozze di Figaro* with Long Island Opera. 

She was a winner of the Puerto Rico District for the Metropolitan Opera National Auditions as well as the Osgood/dell’Arte Opera Ensemble competition in New York City.  Last season, Alicea sang in the Opernstar Konzert in Bremen, Germany.  With dell’Arte Opera Ensemble she sang Servilia in *La Clemenza di Tito* by W.A. Mozart.  Credits in partial operatic roles include Rosina in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia*, title role in *Semiramide*, Adina in *L’elisir d’amore*, Elvira in *I Puritani*, Zerlina in *Don Giovanni*, Maria in *West Side Story*, Pamina in *Die Zauberflöte*, and Juliette in *Roméo et Juliette*.
