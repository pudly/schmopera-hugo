Canadian-Italian soprano Aviva Fortunata, named twice as one of CBC’s Top 30 Canadian Classical Artists Under 30, is earning international attention with her “velvety timbre”, “gleaming tone”, and voice “of diva soprano quality and strength”. To great acclaim, she stepped in last-minute to replace an ailing colleague in the title role of _Norma_ at The Dallas Opera, securing the _bel canto_ heroine as one of Ms. Fortunata’s signature roles.

Postponed due to COVID-19, Ms. Fortunata’s rescheduled 2020-21 season sees her as Donna Anna in Pacific Opera Victoria’s upcoming production of _Don Giovanni_ (TBD), and as Hanna Glawari in Calgary Opera’s _The Merry Widow_ (2022).

In the 2019-20 season, Ms. Fortunata took her Norma to Calgary Opera in a triumphant company debut, “where her vocal strength, brilliant top register, and excellent coloratura singing were heard to thrilling effect.” (Kenneth DeLong, _Calgary Herald_). She headlined _Il trittico_ at Pacific Opera Victoria (2019) as Nella in _Gianni Schicchi_, a “standout” Giorgetta in _Il tabarro_, and in the title role of _Suor Angelica_, where “Fortunata’s heart-rending ‘Senza mamma’...was tremendous, sung with creamy lyricism and thrilling high notes.” (_Times Colonist_) Internationally, Ms. Fortunata joined the ensemble of Deutsche Oper Berlin, singing in their recent productions of _Die Zauberflöte_ (First Lady), _Das Märchen von der Zauberflöte_ (First Lady), _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ (Berta), and _Nabucco_ (Anna). Ms. Fortunata’s return to DOB, which was to include Sacerdotessa in Verdi’s _Aida_, was cut short by COVID-19.

In recent seasons, Ms. Fortunata has been a notable presence on the stage of the Canadian Opera Company. While covering the title role in _Norma_ for Sondra Radvanovsky, she also sang the role of Clotilde in the same production. In the same season, she appeared as First Lady in the COC’s production of _The Magic Flute_, and later made a last-minute step-in as Third Norn and Gutrune in the _Götterdämmerung._ Additionally, Ms. Fortunata has spent the last few seasons making significant role debuts at houses Canada-wide, including Leonore in _Fidelio_ with Pacific Opera Victoria, Tosca with Opera on the Avalon, and Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_ with Saskatoon Opera.

Ms. Fortunata is an alumna of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio Program (2013-2016), where she took the mainstage as Fiordiligi in _Così fan tutte_, Helmwige in _Die Walküre_, Annina in _La traviata_, and Berta in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_. Additionally, she covered Anna in _Maometto II_, Alice Ford in _Falstaff_, Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_, and Ellen Orford in _Peter Grimes_. As a member of San Francisco Opera’s Merola Opera Program (2012-2013), Ms. Fortunata sang Desdemona in Verdi’s _Otello_, and Lady with a Cake Box in Argento’s _Postcard from Morocco_.

On the concert stage, Ms. Fortunata performed Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_ with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony under Music Director Andrei Feher, and excerpts from Wagner’s _Lohengrin_ (Elsa) with the Victoria Symphony. Ms. Fortunata gave several recitals in the Canadian Opera Company’s Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, including Messaien’s _Poèmes pour Mi_, Britten’s _Ekho poeta_, and the Canadian premiere of John Greer’s piano quintet arrangement of Strauss’ _Vier letzte Lieder_.

Ms. Fortunata was a 2016 Finalist for Operalia, The World Opera Competition, and she was Canada's representative in the 2015 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, where she was a Song Prize Finalist. She holds a Masters Degree in Opera from the University of Toronto. Ms. Fortunata was generously sponsored by the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation, Alberta Foundation for the Arts, and the Sylva Gelber Music Foundation Award.
