Acclaimed as an “intense, concentrated artist” (_Opera News_) with a voice of “dark beauty and lustrous tone” (_Birmingham Post_), Magdalena Anna Hofmann has been celebrated at many of the world’s most important opera houses, festivals and concert halls. Her repertoire spans some of the great heroines of the German and Slavic repertoire as well as Mozart roles, operetta and modern music.

Scheduled for the next few months are Isolde in Tristan und Isolde at the Staatsoper Hannover and in a new production at the Prague National Theatre.

Performances of the 2019/20 season have included her double debut as Leonore in _Fidelio_ at the Teatro Comunale of Bologna, a role she also performed in a new production in Heidelberg; Sieglinde in _Die Walküre_ and Gutrune in _Götterdämmerung_ in Minden as well as Sieglinde with the Cracow Philharmonics. A new staging of _Lessons of love and violence_ for Theater St. Gallen and Schönberg’s _Pierrot Lunaire_ at the Wigmore Hall were cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

In the 2018/19 season, she made her acclaimed role debut as Isolde in a new production of _Tristan und Isolde_ in Hagen (“A sensational discovery in the Wagner repertoire”, Westfalenpost), performed Sieglinde in _Die Walküre_ in Tianjin, Gutrune in _Götterdämmerung_ in Minden and Mendelssohn’s _Lobgesang_ with the Warsaw Philharmonics.

Performances of the 2017/18 season included Kundry in _Mondparsifal Beta 9–23_ at the Berliner Festspiele, the title role of Jenö Hubay’s _Anna Karenina_ in a new production at the Bern Opera House, Schönberg’s _Gurrelieder_ at the Casa da Música in Porto, Kurt Weill’s _Silbersee-Gesänge_ with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and Sieglinde in _Die Walküre_ at the Tiroler Festspiele in Erl.

Recent highlights have led her to the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen as Frau in Schönberg’s _Erwartung_ and as Senta in _Der fliegende Holländer_, to the Wiener Festwochen as Kundry in the world premiere of _Mondparsifal alpha 1–8_ (B. Lang / R. Wagner), to the Berliner Philharmonie, the Birmingham Symphony Hall and to Bern with _Erwartung_, to the Aalto-Theater of Essen and to Bonn as Senta, to Minden for her role debut as Sieglinde in _Die Walküre_, to the Aalto-Theater as The Foreign Princess in _Rusalka_, to the Cesis Concert Hall in Latvia for her first Elsa in _Lohengrin_ and to the Casa da Música in Porto for Wagner’s _Wesendonck-Lieder_ and _Isoldes Liebestod_.

Magdalena Anna Hofmann was born in Warsaw and completed her formal vocal training in Vienna. She began her career as a mezzo-soprano, appearing at opera houses and festivals such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Theater an der Wien and the Bregenz Festival.

In 2011 she sang her first soprano role, Contessa in _Le nozze di Figaro_ at the Klosterneuburg Festival, followed by her first and highly acclaimed Kundry in a new production of _Parsifal_ at the Rahvusooper, Tallinn. Performances since then have included several important debuts such as _Erwartung_ and Dallapiccola’s _Il prigioniero_ at the Opéra of Lyon, Portia in André Tchaikovsky’s _The Merchant Of Venice_ at the Bregenz Festival and concerts in Osaka, Porto, Stuttgart as well as at the Bad Urach Festival. In October 2014 she scored an exceptional success in her role debut as Senta in _Der fliegende Holländer_ in Lyon, where she returned the following year as Carlotta in a new production of Schreker’s _Die Gezeichneten_.

Magdalena Anna Hofmann has worked with conductors such as Daniel Harding, Kirill Petrenko, Daniele Gatti, Bertrand de Billy, Michael Boder, Kazushi Ono, Hartmut Keil, Lothar Königs, Riccardo Frizza, Gaetano d’Espinosa, Bernhard Kontarsky, Patrick Summers, Alejo Perez, Tomáš Netopil as well as Vladimir Fedoseyev and stage directors such as Keith Warner, Àlex Olle (La Fura dels Baus), Nicola Raab, Peter Stein, Frank Castorf, Stéphane Braunschweig, Valentina Carrasco, John Fulljames, William Friedkin, Gerd Heinz, Daniel Slater, Lotte de Beer, David Bösch and Walter Sutcliffe.
