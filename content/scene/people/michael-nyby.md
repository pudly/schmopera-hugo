Born in Ontario and raised in New Jersey, Canadian-American baritone Michael Nyby has performed extensively in opera, concert, and theatre throughout Canada and the United States.  Michael is a successful interpreter of new music, and has numerous world premieres to his credit. In recent years, Michael created the role of Brent Colgate in the world premiere of Gregory Vajda’s *Georgia Bottoms* with the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra, the role of William Dale in Minnesota Opera’s world premiere production of Kevin Puts's Pulitzer-Prize-winning *Silent Night*, and the role of Seth in Peter Anthony Togni's *Isis and Osiris* with Toronto's Opera in Concert. Michael’s additional new music credits include the world premiere of Scott Wheeler’s *200 Dreams* from Captivity with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, Larysa Kuzmenko's *Golden Harvest* with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the role of Demetrio in the second performance of Kristin Hevner Wyatt’s *Il Sogno* with Opera Ithaca, and the singing role of the Young Man in the Canadian Premiere of Joe DiPietro’s play *The Last Romance* for Theatre Aquarius.

Particularly noted in concert for his interpretation of *Carmina Burana*, Michael was praised for his “stentorian masculinity” by Musical Toronto after his debut performance of the Orff masterpiece with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, and for the "incredible control and command of his tender and rich baritone" by The Walleye after his performance with the Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra. He has since performed *Carmina Burana* with orchestras across Canada to rave reviews . 

Michael resides in Toronto with his beautiful wife and poorly-behaved cat. He is an alumnus of Ithaca College (Bachelor of Music, '05) and the University of British Columbia (Master of Music, '09). Some of his interests outside of music include coffee, craft beer, and competitive cycling. He is an unapologetic fan of the New York Yankees and the Vancouver Canucks and welcomes all sports-related trash talk opportunities. A handsome devil, Michael is frequently featured on the [Barihunks](http://barihunks.blogspot.com/search?q=nyby) blog.
