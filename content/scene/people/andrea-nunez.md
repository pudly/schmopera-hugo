Praised for her "blinding brilliance," Canadian Soprano **Andrea Núñez** is establishing herself as a versatile young artist.

Upcoming this season, Andrea makes her house debut at Pacific Opera Victoria, singing Frasquita in their production of Bizet’s _Carmen_, returns to Toronto Operetta Theatre for Adele in _Die Fledermaus_, and looks forward to debuting Juliette in Gounod’s _Roméo et Juliette_. She recently completed a residency at National Sawdust, working with celebrated librettist Royce Vavrek and composer Vivian Fung on a cycle of songs centred on her identity and experiences as a multi-racial Canadian, supported by the Canada Council for the Arts.

In 21/22, Andrea opened Opéra de Montréal’s season with a double bill of Vaughn-Williams’ _Riders to the Sea_ and Labrosse’s _Flambeau de la nuit_. She rejoined the company for their celebrated production of Barrie Kosky’s Mozart’s _The Magic Flute_ as First Lady. The season also saw a rescheduling of Toronto Operetta Theatre’s _A Waltz Dream_, with Núñez in the lead role of Princess Helene.

Ms. Núñez is an alumna of l'Atelier Lyrique de l'Opera de Montréal, where she performed the roles of the Page in _Rigoletto_, Woglinde in _Das Rheingold_, and Alice B. Toklas in Ricky Ian Gordon's _27_. She also performed the roles of the Governess in _The Turn of the Screw_ in collaboration with the Orchestre de l'Agora and Giulia in _La Scala di seta_ in collaboration with the Orchestre symphonique de la Vallée-du-Haut-Saint-Laurent.

In 2018, Ms. Núñez returned to Opera Theatre of Saint Louis for her second year as a Gerdine Young Artist and was a recipient of a Richard Gaddes Career Award. That season, she went on to create the role of Pvt. Sonia Gonzalez in the world premier of Huang Ruo & David Henry Hwang's _An American Soldier_. During her first year at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Ms. Núñez performed the role of Butterfly's Cousin in _Madame Butterfly_ and she covered the role of Rosasharn in Ricky Ian Gordon's _The Grapes of Wrath_.

Ms. Núñez, cover artist for the role of Fiakermilli in the Canadian Opera Company's production of _Arabella_, is an alumnus of the Calgary Opera Emerging Artist Program where she performed the roles of Ellen in _Lakmé_, Le Feu and Le Rossignol in _L’enfant et les sortilèges_, and Papagena in _Die Zauberflöte_. She also covered the title role in _Lakmé_ and the Queen of the Night in _Die Zauberflöte_.

In June 2015, Ms. Núñez joined the Santa Fe Opera Apprentice Artist Program where she had her American debut as Monterone’s Daughter/Page in _Rigoletto_. She also created the role of Laura in the world premiere of Jennifer Higdon’s _Cold Mountain_. In Canada that season, she toured Ontario and Quebec performing the role of Norina in _Don Pasquale_ as part of the Jeunesses Musicales Canada Emerging Artist Tour. Along with her many operatic credits, Ms. Núñez has also performed concert works with the Pax Christi Chorale, the Toronto Mozart Players, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

A participant in many national and international competitions, Ms. Núñez represented Canada at the Queen Sonja International Music Competition in Norway, was a semi-finalist at the Voix Nouvelles competition in Massy, France and a District Finalist (Buffalo/Toronto District) at the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. She received the Roberta Peters Award from the George London Foundation, won the Toronto Mozart Project Vocal Competition, is a Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyrique Laureate, and a finalist in the Canadian Opera Company's Centre Stage Competition.
