Tom Verney began singing as a treble in Kingston Parish Church.  As a countertenor, he spent a year as a lay-clerk in Perth Cathedral, Western Australia, before taking up a Choral Scholarship at St. John’s College, Cambridge, and studying for a degree in philosophy.  Having completed the Opera Course at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he now studies there with Andrew Watts, and also learns with Arwel Treharne Morgan.
 
His operatic experience includes roles in *L’amfiparnaso* (Vecchi) for Cambridge University, Athamas *Semele* for Hampstead Garden Opera, Testis 1 in Jonathan Miller’s production of Bach’s *St. Matthew Passion* at the National Theatre, cover Military Governor *A Night at the Chinese Opera* for British Youth Opera, Oberon *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* for Shadwell Opera in Cambridge, the Rosslyn Chapel (as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival), for Guildhall Opera in the Barbican Theatre and, most recently, for a joint production with the Royal Scottish Conservatoire and Scottish Opera – in Eden Court in Inverness, the King’s Theatre in Edinburgh and the Theatre Royal in Glasgow, Fox / Coachman in *The Adventures of Pinocchio* by Jonathan Dove and the title role in *San Giovanni Battista* by Stradella, both for Guildhall Opera, the title role in *The Little Green Swallow* by Jonathan Dove for British Youth Opera, Corrado in *Griselda* by Vivaldi for Opera Settecento in the Cadogan Hall, Unulfo (cover) in Handel's *Rodelinda* for Scottish Opera, Voice of Apollo in Britten's *Death in Venice* for Garsington Opera, and Narciso in Handel's *Agrippina* for Iford Opera. 

Future plans include Hamlet (cover) in *The Firework Maker's Daughter* by Bruce for ROH2 Linvury Theatre, and Narciso in Handel's *Agrippina* with the Theater an der Wein. His studies are generously supported by the William Gibbs Educational Trust and he is an Independent Opera Fellow.
