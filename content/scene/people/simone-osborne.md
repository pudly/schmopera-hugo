Canadian soprano Simone Osborne has been hailed as "a joy to hear" (_Los Angeles Times_) with "a sweet and clear sound, sensitive phrasing and gleaming sustained high notes" (_New York Times_). Ms. Osborne was one of the youngest winners of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

In the 23-24 season, Simone will debut with Calgary Opera in _L'elisir d'amore_ (Adina) and return to the Canadian Opera Company for _Don Pasquale_ (Norina). Recent performances include a debut with the Victoria Symphony for a New Year's Day Celebration concert, a return to Oper Frankfurt for _La serva padrona_ (Serpina), a return to the Canadian Opera Company for _Hänsel und Gretel_ (Gretel) conducted by Johannes Debus followed by her role-house-country debut at Oper Frankfurt in the Delius A Village _Romeo and Juliet_ (Juliet) conducted by Elias Grandy. Additional recent engagements include debuts with Festival d'opéra de Québec and Pacific Opera Victoria in the new Lepage production of _Die Zauberflöte_ (Pamina) conducted by Thomas Rösner and a new production of Somers' _Louis Riel_ (Marguerite Riel) at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa and Opéra de Québec.

A graduate of the Canadian Opera Company's Studio Ensemble program, Ms. Osborne has returned to the COC for _L'elisir d'amore_ (Adina), Carmen (Micäela), in Carsen's production of _Falstaff_ (Nannetta), _Un ballo in maschera_ (Oscar), _La bohème_ (Musetta), Christopher Alden's _Rigoletto_ (Gilda), _Gianni Schicchi_ (Lauretta) conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, and _Die Zauberflöte_ (Pamina) conducted by Debus.

She was also seen in _Carmen_ (Frasquita), _Maria Stuarda_ (Anne Kennedy), and _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ (Rosina) on tour, as well as a performance of the Pribaoutki songs in the premiere of Robert Lepage's _The Nightingale and Other Short Fables_.

Simone was seen in her hometown of Vancouver in _Rigoletto_ (Gilda), _Roméo et Juliette_ (Juliette), and _Die Zauberflöte_ (Pamina) with Vancouver Opera. She joined the Vancouver Symphony and Bach Choirs for Handel's _Messiah_, and gave a recital for the Music in the Morning series.
