Shelton owned the final scene, as his character descended into despair fueled by psychotic obsession. His bright tone amplified the intensity of the last gripping moments.”  In the 2017-18 season, he returns to Houston Grand Opera for two exciting role debuts: Pollione in *Norma* and Aegisth in *Elektra* before returning to the Metropolitan Opera roster for the latter title.
