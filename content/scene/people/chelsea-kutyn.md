This summer Canadian soprano Chelsea Kutyn debuts as "Magda" from Menotti's _The Consul_ (Opera NUOVA) and as "Susanna" from Mozart's _The Marriage of Figaro_ (Manitoba Underground Opera).

Recent performances include Chelsea's debut as “Poppea” in Monteverdi’s _L'incoronazione di Poppea_ (Desautels Faculty of Music Chamber Opera) and musical theatre scenes in the roles of "Sargent Sarah" from _Guys and Dolls_, "Velma Kelly" from _Chicago_, "Catherine Parr" from Six, and "Beth" from _Merrily We Roll Along_ (Desautels Faculty of Music Theatre Ensemble).  

Chelsea is the 2022 recipient of the Rose Bowl, George H. Price Memorial Scholarship, and Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra Community Concert Performance Award from the Winnipeg Music Festival. 

Past projects include Pacific Opera Victoria’s “Apprentice Civic Engagement Quartet,” a mentorship program for authentic storytelling and community engagement through workshops and digital projects.

Studying with Monica Huisman, Chelsea will add a MMus (2022) to her collection of degrees including a BCom (2016) -majoring in entrepreneurship- and a BMus (2020) in voice performance.

Following the advice of mentor Ben Butterfield who said, “Don’t bore me!” Chelsea plans to use her skills from business and performing to explore opportunities in classical music, music theatre, and voice over.
