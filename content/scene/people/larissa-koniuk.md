I am a singer, performer, voice teacher, workshop clinician, and adjudicator with over 12 years of experience. As an active performer, my focus has been in contemporary opera, having appeared in many premieres such as: _Sweat_ by Juliet Palmer and Anna Chatterton (Centre for Contemporary Opera, New York), Chris Thornborrow and Julie Tepperman's _Selfie_ (Tapestry Opera), Adam Scime's _L'homme et le ciel_ (FAWN Opera), Brian Current's _Airline Icarus_ (Soundstreams), Dean Burry and Lorna MacDonald's _The Bells of Baddeck_, and Stephanie Martin's _Llandovery Castle_.

On the concert stage, I have recently been engaged by Theatre of Early Music, Toronto Masque Theatre, Pax Christi Chorale, Oriana Singers, Quinte Symphony, and Cantabile Choirs.

I am also the co-founder and artistic director of the Bicycle Opera Project, a company that champions new opera works and tours exclusively by bicycle! With Bicycle Opera, I have performed over 20 new works with Ottawa International Chamberfest, The Toronto Symphony Orchestra's New Creations Festival, The Royal Conservatory of Musicâ€™s 21C Festival, Stratford Summer Music, Westben Festival, and in numerous unusual performance spaces all over Ontario.
