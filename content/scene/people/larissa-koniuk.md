Larissa Koniuk is a Toronto-based singer, actor, and avid cyclist. Equally experienced in opera, concert, and recital repertoire, Larissa’s artistic concentration is in the creation and collaboration of new opera works. Larissa is currently the co-founder and artistic director of the Bicycle Opera Project, producing and performing contemporary opera in venues across Ontario in July 2012 and 2013.  As a performer with the Bicycle Opera Project, the soprano has recently been seen in productions at the Green Door Cabaret, Innovations en Concert in Montreal, Aeolian Hall in London, and a three-day residency with the Stratford Summer Music Festival. 

Larissa has performed and premiered many solo concert works including the premiere of *Thin Straight Lines: a song cycle for soprano and quartet* by Anna Höstman, the Toronto premiere of Adam Scime’s *Images of John A Wilson: a mini opera for soprano*, and *The Handless Maiden: a one-act monodrama* by Wende Bartley, performed at Daniels Spectrum.  On the opera stage, Larissa was heard most recently in the premiere of John Beckwith’s *Taptoo!* with Toronto Operetta Theatre, and in *Like an Old Tale: a multi-disciplinary puppet-opera* with an original opera score by Juliet Palmer, and appeared in Against the Grain Theatre’s modern adaptation of Puccini’s *La Boheme*. 

This current season, Larissa will be performing in FAWN Opera’s production of *L’homme et le ciel*: a new opera by Adam Scime, and in Soundtream’s Canadian premiere of Brian Current’s opera *Airline Icarus*. A graduate of Wilfred Laurier University, Larissa holds a Bachelor of Music degree in vocal performance.
