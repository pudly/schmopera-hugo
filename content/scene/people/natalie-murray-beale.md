Natalie Murray Beale has been critically acclaimed as “a young conductor on her way up”. Other reviews have described her conducting as “exceptional”, “charming and vigorous” and having “Mozartian grace”.

She is in demand for her work on contemporary repertoire in concerts, opera and the recording studio. One notable success was the new opera commission We are Shadows at the Spitalfield’s Festival, winner of a Royal Philharmonic Society Award. She has collaborated with composers John Barber, Sally Beamish, Christian Henson and James MacMillan and conducted the National Opera Studio contemporary opera programme for 2 years running. She has also conducted high-profile commercial recordings which include the eagerly awaited British film 'Our Robot Overlords' (starring Gillian Anderson, Ben Kingsley) and the 'Alien' video game, both due for release this year.

Natalie also has a particular interest in late 18th Century repertoire. Since 2012 she has worked closely with Jérémie Rhorer and Paris-based period orchestra Le Cercle de L'Harmonie, concentrating on the operas of Mozart and Gluck.

Other recent engagements include *Madama Butterfly*, *Alice in Wonderland* (Opera Holland Park/City of London Sinfonia), *Partenope*, *Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno* (Opéra Les Azuriales), *Fra Diavolo* (Stanley Hall) and 20 Women Singing (Welsh National Opera).

Natalie has gained valuable experience as an assistant conductor for leading international festivals and theatres such as Festival d'Aix (*Le Nozze di Figaro*) Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (*Dialogues des Carmélites, Don Giovanni*), Wiener Festwochen (*Orfeo ed Euridice*), Den Nye Opera (*Le Nozze di Figaro*) and Independent Opera, Sadler's Wells (*Pelléas et Mélisande, Orlando*) working with the Philharmonia, Bergen Philharmonic, Le Cercle de l'Harmonie and B'Rock orchestras.

Australian-born, Natalie trained at Sydney Conservatorium before moving to London to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the National Opera Studio. She went on to train with Finnish maestro and teacher, Jorma Panula.

Prior to taking up conducting Natalie was a highly successful répétiteur, opera coach and chorus director. She was an Associate Artist at Welsh National Opera, on the music staff at the Glyndebourne Festival and pianist/coach for the Royal Opera House Young Artist Programme. Natalie became one of the youngest ever Professors at the Royal College of Music and was a recipient of the London Symphony Chorus Conducting Scholarship which led to her becoming Guest Chorus Director of LSC. She worked closely with Valery Gergiev, Sir Colin Davis, Marin Alsop, Daniele Gatti, Mariss Jansons and Xian Zhang on a wide range of concert repertoire for performances at the Barbican, Royal Festival Hall, Royal Albert Hall and Salle Pleyel.

In addition to her conducting work Natalie continues as a Professor at the Royal College of Music and is Artistic Advisor to Independent Opera at Sadler’s Wells.
