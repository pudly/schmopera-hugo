Praised with an exciting sound, Mezzo-Soprano Samantha Attaguile is quickly establishing herself as a spirited young talent in the modern artistic world. Most recently, Samantha appeared as Lola in Main Street Opera's production of *Cavalleria rusticana*. In November, Samantha will debut with Chicago Fringe Opera, appearing as Hannah after in the Chicago premiere of the critically acclaimed opera *As One*, a chamber piece for two voices and string quartet depicting the experiences of a sole transgender protagonist.

Other performance highlights include Flora (*The Enchanted Pig* by Jonathan Dove), Lola (*Cavalleria rusticana*), and Dido (*Dido and Aeneas*) with Opera Steamboat (formerly Emerald City Opera), Barbara Ansley (*Roman Fever* by Robert Ward) with Opera on Tap Chicago, Dorabella (*Così fan tutte*) with Opera in the Ozarks and The Floating Opera Company, Cherubino (*Le nozze di Figaro*) with Luke Housner's Portland Summer Opera Workshop, Phoebe Meryll (*The Yeomen of the Guard*) with The Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company,  Maddalena (*Il viaggio a Reims*), Vèronique (*Doctor Miracle*), Nurse (*Strawberry Fields* by Michael Torke), and The Abbess (*Sister Angelica*) with the Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University. Scene credits include both the title role and Mercédès from Bizet's beloved *Carmen*, Third Lady (*The Magic Flute*), and Octavian (*Der Rosenkavalier*). 

An advocate of new music, Samantha has had the privilege to premiere and record solo vocal works by American composers Benjamin Harrell and Clayton Horath, and performed the Chicago premiere of pieces by Colombian composer Juan David Osorio. She was also an ensemble member in the Chicago premiere of *The Final Battle for Love* with Thompson Street Opera. In addition to being a Managing Diva of Opera on Tap Chicago, Samantha helped kickstart New Brew Chicago, an offshoot of Opera on Tap dedicated to performing new vocal music. Samantha is also a member of Chicago's premier feminist music collective, Praxilla Femina, a group of female identifying individuals making art out of outrage and calling for social change.

A performer in every sense of the word, Samantha's experience is not limited to the traditional operatic realm, and she enjoys taking part in a wide array of musical and theatrical projects. In 2016, Samantha performed the role of Bystander and covered Sara Jane Moore in Stephen Sondheim's *Assassins* with Petite Opera Productions.  She performs in semi-annual concerts with the Colombian folk group, The Mulati Ensemble, and has appeared as the mezzo-soprano soloist in Duruflé's *Requiem* with the DuPage Chorale as well as with the Southwest Symphony Orchestra singing a concert of Rodgers & Hammerstein classics. For fun and fundraising, Samantha has participated in Compass Creative Dramatics' adaptations of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Peter Pan* to raise money for children’s theatre programs, and appeared as a Puppeteer in Quest Theatre Ensemble's *Blue Nativity*.

Samantha currently works, lives, and performs in Chicago with her outrageously supportive husband, Antoni, and feline fur babies, Desdemona and Ophelia.
