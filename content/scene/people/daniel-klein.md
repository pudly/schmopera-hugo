Imaginative, adventurous, and occasionally downright terrifying, audiences have found in Bass Baritone, Daniel Klein an exciting example of versatility. As he evolves as an artist, so have the roles for which he has been called upon to interpret.  Most recently he captured the complex balance of humor and terror as the Podesta in Bronx Opera's *La Gazza Ladra*, the curse hurling Monterone in Annapolis Opera's *Rigoletto*, the hunchbacked villian as Tonio in Opera Providence's *Pagliacci*, and he brought swagger and comic timing to Fresno Grand Opera’s Pirate King in *Pirates of Penzance*.   This summer he will make his role debut as Emilie de Becque in *South Pacific* with the New Canaan Summer Theater.

Among his other roles are the Count (*Le Nozze di Figaro*) with St. Petersburg Opera; Rambaldo (*La Rondine*) and Marcello (*La Boheme*) with Opera Company of Middlebury; the title role of *Don Giovanni* and Enrico (*Lucia di Lammermoor*) with Dell'Arte Opera;  Iago (*Otello*), Nabucco (*Nabucco*), Scarpia (*Tosca*), and Zurga (*Les pecheurs de perles*) at Taconic Opera.

Daniel recently appeared with the Brooklyn Philharmonic in the world premier of excerpts from Misha Dutka's holocaust opera *Liebovar*.  Previously he has been heard in excerpts from Bolcolm's *A View from a Bridge* as Eddie Carbone with the Vertical Players Repertory, Shamrayeff in Pasatieri’s *The Seagull*  with Dicapo Opera Theatre and the Armel Festival in Szged Hungary, and John Proctor in IVAI Tel Aviv’s production of Robert Ward's *The Crucible*.  

He originated the role of Manfred Guyer in the stage premier of American Opera Project’s *Lost Childhood* and of Morris and Murray in Michael Sahls’ *Dinner and Delusions* at New York City Opera’s VOX Festival. With the New York City Drama Center, Mr. Klein premiered Thomas Toscano’s *Il Peccato di Donna Santa*. His voice can be heard in soundtracks by Emmy Award winning film composer James Michael Dooley.

This past April he appeared Bass Soloist in Beethoven's 9th Symphony with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. He has made several appearances with the Garden State Philharmonic and Chorus including Handel's *Messiah*, Verdi's *Requiem*, and opera pops concerts.   With Castleton College Orchestra VT, he has appeared as a guest artist in Schubert's Mass in G, with the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra as bass soloist in Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  He has appeared in opera in concert with the Bakersfeild Symphony as Gugliemo (*Così fan tutte*) and as Michele (*Il Tabarro*) with the Delaware County Symphony, PA; and in opera highlights with the Santa Cecelia Orchestra, Los Angeles and AIMS Orchestra Graz, Austria.
