Praised for his "clear talent for comic acting" and "clear voice" (Opera Canada), Sri Lankan - Canadian baritone Janaka Welihinda is quickly establishing himself as an artist of note.
 
This past season, Mr. Welihinda rejoined the cast of Metro Youth Opera to present the role of Claudio in *Béatrice et Benedict*, and Shoestring Opera as both Papageno in *La Flûte Enchantée* and as Tory Adair in *Schoolyard Carmen*. He also debuted the roles of Guglielmo in *Cosi Fan Tutte* with Opera by Request, and Harry Easter in the professional Canadian premier of Kurt Weill's *Street Scene* with Opera in Concert under the baton of Robert Cooper.
 
His other roles have included Uberto in *La Serva Padrona*, Bartolo and Antonio in *Le Nozze di Figaro*, Pooh-Bah in *The Mikado*, Frank in *Die Fledermaus*, Ben in *The Telephone*, and Don Alfonso in *Cosi Fan Tutte*. In 2007, Janaka developed the role of Meursault in the Canadian premier of Ian Cherry’s new opera based on the novel by Camus: *L'Étranger*.
