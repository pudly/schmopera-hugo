A choral scholar at King’s College, Cambridge, Purves went on to become a member of experimental rock group Harvey and the Wallbangers.

He also premiered George Benjamin’s *Written on Skin* to widespread critical acclaim at the Festival d’Aix en Provence in July 2012, reprising his role of Protector in subsequent productions at the Royal Opera House, Bayerische Staatsoper, Netherlands Opera and Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse.
