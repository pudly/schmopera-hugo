Quoted as having “a lovely demeanor and irresistible creamy timbre” by _Opera News_, fast-rising, young American soprano Danielle Pastin is gaining accolades from opera houses around the country. Last season, she returned to the Metropolitan Opera stage as Nedda in **_Pagliacci_** and performed in the World Premiere of Robert Paterson’s **_Three Way_** (as Connie in “Masquerade” and Maya in “The Companion”) with Nashville Opera and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which was recorded for release. In addition, she performed Leïla in **_Les pêcheurs de perles_** with Toledo Opera, The Countess in **_Le nozze di Figaro_** with Pittsburgh Opera and for Opera Maine, sang Verdi’s **_Requiem_** with DCINY in Barcelona and with the Dayton Philharmonic, Bruckner’s **_Te Deum_** for the Reno Chamber Orchestra, and performed a Gala Concert for The Society of The Four Arts.

Next, Ms. Pastin reprises the role of Masha in **_Enemies, A Love Story_** with Kentucky Opera, Cio-Cio San in **_Madama Butterfly_** with Virginia Opera, Donna Elvira in **_Don Giovanni_** with Palm Beach Opera, and returns to The Society of The Four Arts in a solo recital.

Ms. Pastin has recently performed with esteemed companies around the country in roles such as Desdemona in **_Otello_** at Pittsburgh Opera and Dayton Opera, Nedda in **_Pagliacci_** and Donna Anna in **_Don Giovanni_** at Austin Lyric Opera, Rosalinde in **_Die Fledermaus_** with Opera Naples, Liú in **_Turandot_** at Nashville Opera, Fiordiligi in **_Così fan tutte_** at Pittsburgh Opera, Hannah in **_The_** **_Merry Widow_** at Pensacola Opera, and Masha in the world première of Ben Moore’s new opera **_Enemies, A Love Story_** at Palm Beach Opera. She also recently sang a Gala Concert with Macau-Beijing Festival in China.

She made her main-stage Metropolitan Opera début singing Masha and covering Chloë in **_The Queen of Spades_** and has been invited back several times since, covering the role of Javotte in a new production of Massenet’s **_Manon_**, covering Samaritana in **_Francesca da Rimini_**, and performing Frasquita in **_Carmen_**, a role she also performed in her début with the Dallas Opera.

Pastin triumphed in her Santa Fe Opera début, stepping in as Mimì in **_La bohème_** under the direction of Maestro Leo Vordoni on just a few hours’ notice and subsequently received their Judith Raskin Memorial Award for Singers. She has since performed the role to international critical acclaim in venues such as The Royal Albert Hall in London, Manitoba Opera, Arizona Opera, Nashville Opera, and most recently with Syracuse Opera. Other recent highlights include performing the role of Gazardiel in the world première of **_Free Will_** with the Savonlinna Opera Festival in her European début; Violetta in **_La traviata_** and the Countess in **_Le nozze di Figaro_** with Syracuse Opera; Micaëla in **_Carmen_** at Fresno Grand Opera, Northern Lights Music Festival, and Finger Lakes Opera; and Giulietta in Bellini’s **_I Capuleti e i Montecchi_** at Annapolis Opera.

Also recognized for her recital and concert performances, Ms. Pastin made her Pittsburgh Symphony début singing Juliet in Tchaikovsky’s rarely performed **_Romeo and Juliet_**. Additionally, she débuted with the Erie Philharmonic Orchestra as the soprano soloist in Verdi’s **_Requiem_**, returning soon after for Barber’s **_Knoxville: Summer of 1915_**, as well as performing as a distinguished alumna at a concert with The Pittsburgh Concert Society.

As a first-year Apprentice Artist with Santa Fe Opera, she was featured as Nedda in a scene from Leoncavallo’s **_Pagliacci_**, and upon returning to Santa Fe for a second year performed as the title character in the famous _Saint-Sulpice_ scene from Massenet’s **_Manon_**. As a Resident Artist at Pittsburgh Opera, Ms. Pastin delighted audiences in her main-stage début in the East Coast première of Ricky Ian Gordon’s epic opera, **_The Grapes of Wrath_** as Rosasharn, then returned as Female Chorus in **_The Rape of Lucretia_**, Mimì in **_La bohème_**, and The Countess in **_Le nozze di Figaro_**. Ms. Pastin was also a Resident Artist at the Intermezzo Opera Festival Training Program, and an Apprentice Artist at Central City Opera in Colorado, where she received the Fine Arts Fellowship and performed the role of Lucinda in the world première of Henry Mollicone’s **_Gabriel’s Daughter_**.

In 2011, Danielle was named a Sullivan Foundation Award winner, and in 2012 she won Second Place in The Gerda Lissner Foundation International Vocal Competition and won the Opera Index Vocal Competition.
