Soprano Patricia Racette has appeared in the most acclaimed opera houses of the world including the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Canadian Opera Company, Royal Opera House, La Scala, Paris Opera, Theater an der Wien, Gran Teatro del Liceu, and the Bayerische Staatsoper. Established as a great interpreter of Janáček and Puccini, she has gained particular acclaim for her portrayals of the title roles of Madama Butterfly, Tosca, Jenufa, Kátya Kabanová, and all three lead soprano roles in _Il Trittico_. Her repertory now expands to include triumphant portrayals of Strauss’s Salome, Minnie in _La Fancuilla del West_, Katerina in _Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk_, Magda in Menotti’s _The Consul_, Anna Maurrant in _Street Scene_, Kostelnička in _Jenufa_, and Elle in _La voix humaine_. In the fall of 2019, she will add to this list Sister Helen in Jake Heggie’s _Dead Man Walking_ which she performs at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. She has been a favorite on The Met: Live in HD series as both leading lady in _Madama Butterfly_, _Tosca_, and _Peter Grimes_ as well as the celebrated host for multiple other productions.

A champion of new works, Ms. Racette has created roles in a number of world premieres, including Leslie Crosbie in Paul Moravec’s _The Letter_ at The Santa Fe Opera, Roberta Alden in Tobias Picker’s _An American Tragedy_ at the Metropolitan Opera, the title role in Tobias Picker’s _Emmeline_ at the Santa Fe Opera (broadcast on PBS/Albany Records audio), Love Simpson in Carlisle Floyd’s _Cold Sassy Tree_ at the Houston Grand Opera, and most recently, the title role in Tobias Picker’s _Dolores Claiborne_ at the San Francisco Opera.

Ms. Racette made her directorial debut with a new production of _La Traviata_ at the Opera Theatre of St. Louis in the summer of 2018. Plans to direct _Susannah_ at the Opera Theatre of St. Louis and a production of _La voix humaine_ starring herself at the Dallas Opera in the spring of 2020 were unfortunately cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic.

Ms. Racette was recently named the Artistic Director of Opera Theatre of St Louis’ Gerdine Young Artist and Richard Gaddes Festival Artist programs. She also continues to be sought after for master classes and workshops to foster artistry in the next generation of classical singer. In January 2017, she presented the pilot program of her intensive seminar, Integrative Artistry, at the San Francisco Conservatory, and has since presented it at The Juilliard School and the Washington National Opera.

Born and raised in New Hampshire, Ms. Racette studied jazz and music education at North Texas State University. Among her recognitions are an Opera News Award, the prestigious Richard Tucker Award, and the Marian Anderson Award. She also received the 2017 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for her performance in the Los Angeles Opera’s production of _The Ghosts of Versailles_.
