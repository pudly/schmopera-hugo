American baritone Joseph Lattanzi is gaining notice for his “robust vocalism,” “unmistakable charisma,” and “undeniable star potential.” Lattanzi will join the Arizona Opera in the 2015-2016 season for performances in *Arizona Lady*, *Florencia en el Amazonas*, *Carmen*, and *Don Giovanni*. The 2014-2015 season began with a return home to debut with The Atlanta Opera as Yamadori in *Madama Butterfly* and included workshopping new operas by Jake Heggie (*Great Scott*) and Daniel Catán (*Meet John Doe*), revisiting Fellow Travelers at the Opera America National Opera Center, soloing in *Carmina Burana* with the Chicago Sinfonietta, and performing Guglielmo in *Così fan tutte*. The 2013-2014 season included his return to Seattle Opera in *The Consul*, a debut season with Cincinnati Opera in three roles, and an exciting international debut in Benjamin Britten's *War Requiem* with the Orchestra e Coro Sinfonica di Milano "Giuseppe Verdi". Recently, Lattanzi garnered much acclaim for his performances of Il Conte in Mozart's *Le Nozze di Figaro* led by Xian Zhang at San Francisco Opera's Merola Opera Program. Equally at home in standard and new repertoire, Lattanzi created the role of Hawkins Fuller in the 2013 workshop of Gregory Spears' new opera *Fellow Travelers*. In the 2011-2012 season, Mr. Lattanzi was recognized by Opera News Magazine for his "fresh, bright baritone voice" as Moralès in Bizet’s *Carmen* with Seattle Opera. As a member of Seattle Opera's Young Artist Program, he also performed the roles of Dr. Malatesta in Donizetti’s *Don Pasquale* and Albert in Massenet’s *Werther*. Other stage credits include the title role in Mozart's *Don Giovanni*, Papageno (*Die Zauberflöte*), Guglielmo (*Così fan tutte*), and Man With a Shoe Sample Kit (*Postcard from Morocco*). The Mableton, GA native has studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music (CCM). In addition to two summers at the Merola Opera Program, he has participated in programs at the Brevard Music Center and the Chautauqua Institute Voice Program.
