A classically trained singer, cabaret artist and composer, Anna Braithwaite's work is distinctly theatrical in nature, thought- provoking, humourous and unexpected.

Anna is delighted to have been selected for inclusion in the British Music Collection. This is a great resource for people interested in discovering the work of the UK's finest composers, past and present. Rebecca Collins has written a 'Spotlight' piece about Anna's work which you can view in full HERE.

_"For me, one of the many strengths of Annaâ€™s work is the method she uses to generate original compositions. In listening to each piece, her presence at each site and the time spent with members of the local community become clear."_

If you are interested in hearing more about how Anna makes her work, please listen to the BBC Radio 3 broadcast of 'Look Up Doncaster' which includes interviews with Anna and other key players in the project or click below to hear her broadcast with Michael Betteridge on Resonance FM discussing verbatim technique in music.
