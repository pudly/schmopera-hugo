Accordingly, the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE noted, "A stellar cast...Scott Joiner brings a bright, arching tenor to the role of Dickon." The national and international press concurred, with THE AMERICAN RECORD GUIDE noting that Joiner's role was "flawlessly sung." SEEN AND HEARD INTERNATIONAL chimed, "Scott Joiner delivered Dickon's music with freshness and a vibrant, piquant sound."

In 2014, Joiner also appeared in the world premiere of the *Boston Tea Party Opera* at the New York International Fringe Festival.

As a principal artist with Asheville Lyric Opera, Mr. Joiner demonstrated a broad range of dramatic and vocal skill, assuming nine roles over four seasons in repertoire that encompassed the works of Donizetti, Puccini, Mozart, and Verdi as well as crossover works. Upon his performance of Gerald Finzi's *For St. Cecilia* with the Asheville Symphony Orchestra, CLASSICAL VOICE OF NORTH CAROLINA singled out Joiner for special praise noting his "high arcing lines, delivered in thrilling fashion" adding that, "this inspired performance was one to remember."
