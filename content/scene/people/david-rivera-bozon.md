I am an international Colombian tenor, based in Boston, with more than sixteen years of experience in music performing. The core of my career has been to share with love the joy of singing; bringing my voice and heart on different latitudes and communities: From big theaters, to flash mobs in bakeries and shopping malls.

On my eclectic international career, some operatic roles includes Puccini's _Madama Butterfly_'s B.F. Pinkerton and Rinuccio in _Gianni Schicchi_, Tamino in Mozart's _Die Zauberflöte_ and Le Mari in Poulenc's _Les Mamelles de Tiresias_. Stage works as: Beethoven's 9th Symphony, Stravinsky's _Les Noces_, Einhorn's _Voices of Light_. I have an special interest into repertoire in Spanish, so I performed chamber works such as Ramirez’ _La Misa Criolla_, Falla’s _Siete Canciones Populares Españolas_, Ginastera's _Cantos del Tucumán_ and _Cinco Canciones Populares Argentinas_.

During these exciting years, I have been also featured in opera, chamber music and zarzuela performances internationally as a soloist and ensemble member with renowned companies such as Central City Opera, Opera on Tap – Boston, Opera Talk Italy, Fundación Jaime Manzur, Coro Filarmónico de Bogotá, Orquesta Filarmónica de Bogotá, Orquesta Sinfónica de Colombia, and Unitas Ensemble. Nowadays I am Artist in Residence of The Grace Note Farm, Music at the Farm program, soloist with the Boston Bel Canto Opera, Coro Dante Alighieri, Opera Talk Italy, Opera on Tap, the Mystic Side Church of Malden. Also I have been frequently featured at the Philharmonia Boston, Calliope, High Street Concert Series, the Rhode Island Encore Opera, the Chelmsford Central Congregational Church, and the Korean Church of Boston, and Saint Peter´s Church in Salem.

Some of my awards includes finalist of the Canto Latino Cyber Challenge 2021 by Vocalis Consort, first prize at both the Rhode Island Civic Chorale & Orchestra (RICCO) Collegiate Vocal Solo Competition in 2018 and the Alliance Française Bogotá Young Talent Music Competition in 2013. Also, I was finalist in the 2017 and 2018 New England Regionals Talents of the World, Inc. Annual Voice Competition, and invited to participate in the New York City Grand Finale in 2018.

I hold proudly a Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance from New England Conservatory, where I studied with Maestro Bradley Williams, and a Bachelor of Music from the Conservatorio de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia where I studied with Maestra Ángela Simbaqueba.
