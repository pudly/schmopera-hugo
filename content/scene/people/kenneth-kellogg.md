Praised for his "commanding stage presence" and "rich, resonant bass," Kenneth Kellogg is quickly gaining recognition as a sought after young artist.

Born and raised in Washington, D.C, music has been a part of his life since grade school. Nurtured in the public school system by amazing music teachers, he participated in choirs throughout the city and began formal training at the Duke Ellington School of the Performing and Visual Arts as a Vocal and Visual Arts student. 

Among his roles, many are staples of opera repertoire:  The title role, in Mozart’s *Don Giovanni*,  as well as Leporello and  Il Commendatore,  Mephistopheles in Gounod’s *Faust*, Don Alfonso in Mozart’s *Cosi fan tutte*, Ramfis and Il Re in Verdi’s *Aida*, Colline in Puccini’s *La Boheme*, the title role of Handel’s *Hercules*, The King in Handel’s *Ariodante*, Osmin in Mozart’s *Die Entführung aus dem Serail*, Sarastro and the Speaker in Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte*, Sparafucile in Verdi’s *Rigoletto*, Fasolt in Wagner’s *Das Rheingold*.

Never afraid to step outside of the box of traditional repertoire, Mr. Kellogg has been involved with several new operas. He sang the role of Queequeg in the workshop of Jake Heggie’s acclaimed, *Moby Dick* at San Francisco Opera.
 
He led the cast in the west coast premier of Terence Blanchard’s *Champion: An Opera in Jazz*, as the champion boxer, Young Emile Griffith, to rave reviews with Opera Parallele.  He has been a guest at the Opera America’s New Works Forum in NY, where among other roles, he brought to life the character of Sam Bankhead in Dan Sonenberg’s Opera, *The Summer King*, about the life of Negro League great, Joshua Gibson.
