Young American Soprano Jessica Fishenfeld, hailed for her “engaging” performances (_Opera News_) and “soaring, glittering high notes” (_EDGEftlauderdale_), “triumphed” (_NY Observer_) in her New York City Opera debut this season as Leah in the World Premiere of _Stonewall_ (Iain Bell & Mark Campbell), with “clean coloratura,” (_Opera News_) and “spunky personality” (_Opera Wire_). Since her recent residency with Palm Beach Opera as a Benenson Young Artist, she starred in the World Premiere of _Lovesick_ at National Sawdust, made her Carnegie/Zankel Hall debut as soloist with The Manhattan Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, appeared with the Helena Symphony in _Bernstein 100!_, was a 2017 Career Bridges Grant Winner, and was awarded a Semi-Finalist Prize in the 2019 Lotte Lenya Competition.

Additionally in 2018/19 season, she reprised Bernstein 100! singing Cunegonde and Maria in selections from _Candide_ and _West Side Story_ with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Symphony Orchestra, made a company debut with On Site Opera as Mrs. Mouse in _The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse_, and returned to Carnegie/Zankel Hall as soloist. She finishes the season singing Norina in _Don Pasquale_ with North Shore Music Festival and returns to Savannah Opera for the World Premiere of _Birthday Clown_ (Ching). She opens the 2019/20 season with a guest appearance at NYC’s Birdland Jazz Club, and returns to Helena Symphony as soprano soloist in _Carmina Burana_.

Among her recent World Premieres, Fishenfeld created the roles of Kim in Eric Salzman’s _Big Jim & the Small-Time Investors_ (Gramercy Opera) and Lydia Douce in Victoria Bond’s _Sirens_ (Cutting Edge Concerts), and sang May Fielding in the North American premiere of Zandonai’s _Il grillo del focolare_ with Teatro Grattacielo. A passionate supporter of new American opera, Fishenfeld created and hosts “Alive & Kicking,” a new web series that curates and promotes such works (to be released July 2019).

As a Benenson Young Artist at Palm Beach Opera, her roles included Mabel (_The Pirates of Penzance_), Norina (_Don Pasquale_), Najade (_Ariadne auf Naxos_), Frasquita (_Carmen_), Kate Pinkerton (_Madama Butterfly_), and Gilda cover (_Rigoletto_). She was recently seen as Lucia in scenes from _Lucia di Lammermoor_ at Savannah Opera, Musetta (_La bohème_) and Frasquita (_Carmen_) with Long Island Lyric Opera, soloist with the St. Bart’s Music Festival (West Indies), Filarmonía de Xalapa (Mexico), Newport Music Festival, Center for Contemporary Opera, Music for Montauk festival, Zerlina (_Don Giovanni_) at the Metropolitan Opera Guild, and Susanna in _Le nozze di Figaro_ with the Miami Music Festival, for which she was hailed for her “crystalline and pure” voice, “large vocal range,” and “spot on comedic timing.”

Early in her career, Fishenfeld appeared in concert at Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio as a guest of (then) Florentine mayor, Matteo Renzi for the 2012 NYU Leadership Conference, soloist in Byron Wu’s Kyrie at Carnegie/Weill Hall, and soloist in the 2011 Classical Singer Convention finals concert. A graduate of the Manhattan School of Music (MM), she was chosen as a finalist in the school’s 2015 Ades Vocal Competition, sang the title role in _Lakmé_, and performed the role of Zerlina in Kenneth Merrill’s production of _Don Giovanni_. At NYU Steinhardt (BM), she performed the roles of Adele (_Die Fledermaus_), Thea (_Fiorello!_), Clara (_The Light in the Piazza_), and Jenny Hildebrand (_Street Scene_).

Other notable performances include Dew Fairy/Gretel cover (_Hansel and Gretel_) at Hubbard Hall Opera Theatre, Annina (_La traviata_) and Tytania (_A Midsummer Night’s Dream_) at Highlands Opera Studio (Canada), and Maestro Lorin Maazel’s 2011 Castleton Festival productions as Susanna (_Le nozze di Figaro_), _Carmen_ in concert (with Denyce Graves), and Mendelssohn’s _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ (with Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons).
