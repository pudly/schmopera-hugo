I never dreamed I'd be an opera singer. I enrolled in a voice performance degree at Wilfrid Laurier University as a way to keep things interesting while completing my B.A. in English, and unexpectedly fell in love with singing. I decided to pursue a Masters degree in opera at the University of Toronto, and then spent three years in the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio program and one year in the Seattle Opera Young Artists Program.

Along the way, I was guided by amazing teachers at a number of training programs, including Glimmerglass Opera's Young American Artists Program, the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, Highlands Opera Studio, the International Vocal Arts Institute, and the Banff Centre’s Opera as Theatre Program. I’m grateful for the generous support I’ve received from many sources, including the Canada Council for the Arts.
