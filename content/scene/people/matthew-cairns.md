One of CBC's 2019 "30 Hot Classical Musicians Under 30," Canadian Matthew Cairns is making a name for himself as one of the most exciting tenors on the rise.

In his first year in the Lindemann Young Artists Program, Mr. Cairns makes his Metropolitan Opera debut as the Messenger in _Aida_ and covers Bob Boles in _Peter Grimes_. Later this season, he sings Macduff in Macbeth at the Canadian Opera Company and Don Jos√© in _Carmen_ at Des Moines Metro Opera.

As former member of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, Mr. Cairns appeared as the Prince of Persia in _Turandot_, the Witch in _Hansel and Gretel_, Gamekeeper in _Rusalka_, and is covering Alfredo in _La traviata_. He's performed Don Ottavio in _Don Giovanni_ and Gherardo in _Gianni Schicchi_ with the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, Liberto in _The Coronation of Poppea_ with Opera Theatre of St. Louis, and Detlef in _The Student Prince_ at the Chautauqua Institution, where he placed first in its Sigma Alpha Iota Competition. Other roles include Count Belfiore in _La finta giardiniera_, Sam Kaplan in _Street Scene_, Sam Sharkey/Lumberjack in _Paul Bunyan_.

Mr. Cairns was a Grand Finals winner of the 2022 Metropolitan Opera Eric and Dominique Laffont Competition and a finalist in the 2022 Neue Stimmen competition. He was the First Prize winner of the 2018 Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio Competition and winner of the CBC Music Young Artist Development Prize.

Mr. Cairns earned his master's degree in opera performance at the University of Toronto.
