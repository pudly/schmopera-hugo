Praised by *Opera News* for his “warm, strong, highly promising tenor," Rolando Sanz is thrilling audiences with his impeccable technique and musical depth, as well as his vocal “color and heartfelt interpretations” (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel). This season, he joins the roster of the Metropolitan Opera for their season-opening production of *Otello*. He also returns to Spoleto Festival USA as tenor soloist in Beethoven's *Choral Fantasy* and Mass in C Major, Washington Concert Opera as Don Gaspar in *La favorite*, and makes his Ash Lawn Opera debut in his signature role of Alfredo in *La traviata*. 

In the 2014-2015 season, Rolando returned to both Florentine Opera and Finger Lakes Opera as Nemorino in *L’elisir d’amore*, joined Baltimore Concert Opera for the U.S. premiere of Franco Faccio’s *Amleto*, and made his Virginia Opera debut as Alfredo.

Rolando has honed his Italianate tenor of “considerable color and strength” (Baltimore Sun) with roles including Alfredo with Florentine Opera and Pacific Symphony, Boris in *Kát’a Kabanová* with Spoleto Festival USA, Rodolfo in *La bohème* with Palm Beach Opera and Opera Idaho, Paolo in Rachmaninov’s *Francesca da Rimini* with the Princeton Festival, Arminio in *I masnadieri* with Washington Concert Opera, Pinkerton (cov) in *Madame Butterfly* with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, and Duca di Mantua in *Rigoletto* with Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra and Annapolis Opera. 

Rolando has displayed his consummate musicianship in concert and oratorio works at the Washington National Cathedral, Aspen Music Festival, and Carnegie Hall in New York City. He is also a strong ambassador of the art song recital. As a resident artist at Songfest, Rolando collaborated with Martin Katz, Graham Johnson, and composer John Harbison. In an upcoming season, he will return to Carnegie Hall to perform the world premiere of a song cycle by composer Ezra Laderman and former United States poet-laureate Robert Pinsky. 

Rolando has been a prizewinner in the Florida Grand Opera/Young Patronesses of the Opera Voice Competition, the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, the Aspen Music Festival Vocal Concerto Competition, and the XIII International Voice Competition in Trujillo, Peru. Most recently, he was awarded the Grand Prize, Conductor Award, and Audience Choice Award at the Annapolis Opera Vocal Competition, 1st place at the Florida Suncoast Opera Guild Competition, and 1st prize at the Marie E. Crump Vocal Competition. Rolando is also proud to have represented his hometown while performing the National Anthem for the nationally televised opening series of the Baltimore Orioles in 2012, 2013, and 2014, and as featured soloist in the Maryland State Art Council’s Star-Spangled Spectacular to commemorate the 200th Anniversary of “The Star-Spangled Banner”. 

Rolando is passionately involved with the musical landscape of the Mid-Atlantic region as an educator and producer. He serves as Artistic Director of Young Artists of America, an organization he co-founded with his brother, conductor Kristofer Sanz. YAA was created to provide talented young musicians with exceptional opportunities to be mentored by professional artists, culminating in fully orchestrated performances of large-scale works of opera, musical theater, and oratorio. This spring, Rolando is executive producer of the world premiere of Andrew Lippa's newest work, "I Am Anne Hutchinson / I Am Harvey Milk," starring Kristin Chenoweth at the Strathmore Music Center.

Rolando is a proud graduate of the Yale University School of Music.
