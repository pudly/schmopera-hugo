Canadian/British bass-baritone Giles Tomkins is widely praised for his vocal virtuosity and lyricism in an impressive range of repertoire. His rich, resonant voice brings “authority and power” to the concert and operatic stage.

Upcoming concert engagements in 2017/18 include Handel’s _Dettingem Te Deum_ with Karen Schuessler Singers in London Ontario, Bach’s Peasant Cantata with Toronto Masque Theatre and Messiah with London Symphonia. Giles joins the cast of _The Overcoat_, a 2018 world premiere of James Rolfe’s new opera, co-produced by Tapestry Opera, Canadian Stage Company and Vancouver Opera, directed by Morris Panych. Giles is delighted to sing the role of Dr. Grenvil next season with Edmonton Opera and Pacific Opera Victoria in their productions of _La Traviata_.

Mr. Tomkins’ operatic roles include Don Basilio (_Il Barbiere di Siviglia_), Raimondo (_Lucia di Lammermoor_), Pistola (_Falstaff_), Superintendent Budd (_Albert Herring_), Leporello/Commendatore (_Don Giovanni_), and Sergeant of Police (_Pirates of Penzance_). He has been engaged by Vancouver Opera, Toronto Operetta Theatre, Pacific Opera Victoria and Edmonton Opera.

Noted for his convincing portrayal of the philosopher Colline in La Bohème, Giles has performed the role with Scottish Opera, as well as with Saskatoon Opera, Manitoba Opera and Pacific Opera Victoria.

Of his role debut in _Turandot_ with Edmonton Opera, Bill Rankin/Opera Canada wrote - "Giles Tomkins sang the role of Liu's master, the aged Timur, and he made the most of the small part with a lustrous tone and appropriately decrepit demeanour”. In 2017, Giles made his Canadian Opera Company debut as Sciarrone in _Tosca_.

Recent oratorio performances include _Elijah_ with Vancouver Bach Choir, _Messiah_ with Elmer Iseler Singers, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with Symphony New Brunswick, Dvorak’s _Requiem_ with Chorus Niagara, _St. John Passion_ with Thirteen Strings Chamber Orchestra and Bach’s Christmas Oratorio with Symphony Nova Scotia, as well as _Messiah_ with Regina Symphony and Thirteen Strings Chamber Orchestra.

On the contemporary music scene, Mr. Tomkins starred as Gandalf in Dean Burry’s _The Hobbit_ with Canadian Children's Opera Company and joined the cast of _The Bells of Baddeck_, Lorna MacDonald and Dean Burry’s music drama based on the life of Alexander Graham Bell.
