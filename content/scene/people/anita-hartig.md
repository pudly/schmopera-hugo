Hailed by the New York Classical Review as having, “a gorgeous instrument with superb dramatic instincts” and possessing a “lovely purity of sound” by the Financial Times, Romanian soprano Anita Hartig is one of the most highly sought-after stars in opera today. During her studies at the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj Napoca, she won several national and international vocal competitions, and made her debut as Mimì in La bohème at the Romanian National Opera in 2006.

From 2009-14 Anita was a member of the ensemble at the Wiener Staatsoper, giving her the opportunity to make her international debut as Musetta *La bohème*. During her time in Vienna, she showcased a number of prestigious roles in house including Pamina *Die Zauberflöte*, Despina *Così fan tutte*, Zerlina *Don Giovanni*, Mimì *La bohème*, Marzelline *Fidelio*, Micaëla *Carmen* and Susanna *Le nozze di Figaro*.

Anita has performed in some of the most important opera houses in the world, including the Bayerische Staatsoper, Kanagawa Kenmin Hall Tokyo, the Megaron Concert Hall Athens, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, La Monnaie Brussels, Deutsche Oper Berlin, Hamburgische Staatsoper, Teatro alla Scala Milan, the Opéra national de Paris, Gran Teatre del Liceu Barcelona and the Metropolitan Opera New York, and with renowned conductors including Adam Fischer, Franz Welser-Möst, Bertrand de Billy, Daniele Rustioni, Carlo Rizzi, Dan Ettinger, Daniel Oren, Mark Elder, Marco Armiliato and Ivor Bolton.

In early 2013 Anita made her Royal Opera House debut as Mimì in John Copley’s renowned production of *La bohème* under the baton of Alexander Joel. The following year, Anita made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera and Opera Bastille as Mimì, before going on to make her house and role debut as Violetta *La traviata* at Gran Teatre del Liceu.

Recent seasons have seen Anita return to Covent Garden as Susanna *Le nozze di Figaro*, to the Wiener Staatsoper and Dresden Semperoper as Mimì and to the Metropolitan Opera to sing Lìu *Turandot* and Susanna *Le nozze di Figaro*. Other stand-out performances include Marguerite *Faust* for Opernhaus Zürich and Wiener Staatsoper and her Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin debut as Mimì.

This season, Anita returns once again to the Metropolitan Opera for Antonia *Les Contes d’Hoffmann*, Mimì at the Teatro Real Madrid, Marguerite *Faust* for both the Wiener Staatsoper and Hamburgische Staatsoper and further appearances in Vienna and the Metropolitan Opera as Mimì in *La bohème*. Anita will round off her season with a concert performance of *Faust* in Moscow and Mimì at the Teatro dell’Opera di Roma.
