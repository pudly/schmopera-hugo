Hailed by The New York Times for her "extraordinary virtuosity and elegance" and declared a "clear showstopper" by Boston Classical Review, American soprano Angela Vallone is currently pursuing her master’s degree at the Juilliard School under the tutelage of Edith Wiens.

At Juilliard, to which she was awarded a full scholarship, Vallone has appeared as the eponymous heroine in Cavalli’s *La Calisto*; as Susanna in *Le nozze di Figaro*; as Pepík in *The Cunning Little Vixen*; as a Spirit in Massenet’s *Cendrillon*; and as the 1st Greek Woman in Gluck’s *Iphigénie en Aulide*, co-produced by the Metropolitan Opera’s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and the Juilliard School—a performance that prompted Opera News to single out her "supple, bell-like soprano" as "a particular delight." In 2015, she was a concert soloist with the Nürnberger Symphoniker, as well as the soloist for Oliver Knussen’s *Requiem: Songs for Sue* with Juilliard’s AXIOM New Music Ensemble, conducted by Jeffrey Milarsky. She also performed the role of Servilia in *La clemenza di Tito* at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow, conducted by Stefano Montanari. 

In addition to her appearances on the opera stage, Ms. Vallone has performed in benefit concerts for the Leslie Simon Breast Care Center (Englewood, NJ). She also organized Songs for Sandy, a charitable event in which she performed alongside Juilliard faculty. As a Gluck Community Service Fellow at Juilliard, she has brought music to numerous hospitals and nursing homes.

Ms. Vallone has participated in master classes led by Marilyn Horne (*The Song Continues* at Carnegie Hall), Brigitte Fassbaender, Stephen King, Felicity Lott, Patricia Racette, Dawn Upshaw, Elly Ameling, Robert Holl, Helmut Deutsch, Roger Vignoles, Julius Drake, Ann Murray, Rudolf Jansen, and many others. She attended the Franz-Schubert-Institut in Baden bei Wien in 2013; was a Tanglewood Music Center Fellow in 2014; and attended the Internationale Meistersinger Akademie in 2015. This past summer, she participated in the Mozart Residency at the Aix-en-Provence Festival.

Ms. Vallone has received a number of scholarships, including the Lorber Memorial Scholarship; the R. Maurice Boyd Scholarship for Vocal Studies; the Anna Case Mackay Scholarship; the Samantha Rose Reverand Scholarship; the Juilliard Alumni Scholarship; the Chairman’s Grant; the Viola Peters Scholarship Fund; the Salvatore Chiantia Scholarship; the Bertha Levin Scholarship; and the P.J. Hoyland Memorial Scholarship, among others.

Following the conclusion of her studies at Juilliard, Ms. Vallone will be performing the role of Susanna in *Le nozze di Figaro* in Santiago, Chile, after which she will join the ensemble of Oper Frankfurt.
