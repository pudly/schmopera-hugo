Praised by Opera Today for “pure, clear tones” and lauded by the Arizona Republic for “purity and vivacious charm,” young soprano Sarah Tucker is demanding attention for her captivating vocal timbre and engaging stage presence.
 
Ms. Tucker was a National Semifinalist in the 2014 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and recently completed her second year as a member of the Arizona Opera Studio.  She was most recently heard as Nelly Nettleton in Arizona Opera’s innovative, multi-lingual production of *Arizona Lady*, in which she not only sang, but also “danced like a flapper” (Opera Today). Her 2015-16 season included several more role debuts with Arizona Opera including Micaëla in *Carmen*, Rosalba in *Florencia en el Amazonas*, and Zerlina in *Don Giovanni* as well as her San Francisco Opera debut as Jano in *Jenufa*.

The 2016-2017 season brought Ms. Tucker’s debut with Utah Opera as Micaëla in *Carmen*, her return to Texas State University as a guest soloist in Stravinsky’s *Les Noces*, and covering the title role in *The Golden Cockerel* at Santa Fe Opera. This season and beyond, she makes her Opera Philadelphia debut where she will reprise First Memory in Lembit Beecher’s *War Stories*, a role which she first premiered with Gotham Chamber Opera in New York City. Additionally, she will sing Gilda in *Rigoletto* with Opera Connecticut and make debuts with The Dallas Opera and San Diego Opera.
