Erwin Schrott is one of the most exciting singers of our time and is universally regarded as today’s finest exponent of the major Mozart roles of Don Giovanni, Leporello and Figaro.

He was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, and made his operatic debut at the age of 22 as Roucher in _Andrea Chénier_. After winning first prize in the 1998 Plácido Domingo “Operalia” Singing Competition, he shot to international fame, making debuts in one major opera house after the other in quick succession. He triumphed in theaters such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Opéra national de Paris, the Washington National Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires, the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Hamburg State Opera, the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa, the Los Angeles Opera and many others. In the summer of 2008 he made his long-awaited debut at the Salzburg Festival as Leporello.

In recent seasons Erwin Schrott has sung Don Giovanni at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, the Teatro alla Scala, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Washington Opera and the Los Angeles Opera, as well as in Seville and Turin and with the Metropolitan Opera on tour to Japan. He has performed the role of Figaro at the Metropolitan Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Zurich Opera, Covent Garden and in Valencia. Other roles in his repertoire have included Pagano in Verdi’s _I Lombardi_, the title role in Verdi’s _Attila_, Banquo in _Macbeth_, Escamillo in _Carmen_, Méphistophélès in Gounod’s _Faust_ and the title role in Boito’s _Mefistofele_.

Engagements in 2011 included _L’elisir d’amore_ at the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía in Valencia and _Le nozze di Figaro_ at the Opéra national de Paris. In the summer of 2011 Erwin Schrott returned to the Salzburg Festival, appearing both as Leporello in _Don Giovanni_ and in the title role of _Le nozze di Figaro_. In July and August he wowed audiences at three major concert events in Germany and Austria alongside Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufmann. The Berlin Waldbühne concert was seen on television by over one million people in more than twenty different countries.

The year 2012 has started with a concert tour of Germany and Switzerland with Anna Netrebko that will extend to the United Kingdom and Denmark later in the year. In February Erwin Schrott returned to Covent Garden for further performances as Don Giovanni. In June he will again join forces with Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufmann for a “Gipfeltreffen der Stars”. They will also be giving a concert in London’s Royal Albert Hall under the title “Opera’s Greatest Stars”. Erwin then also will be performing in _Don Giovanni_ under the direction of Daniel Barenboim at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin.
