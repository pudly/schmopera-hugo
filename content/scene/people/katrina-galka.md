_The Oregonian_ praises soprano Katrina Galka for her recent performances of Adina in _L’elisir d’amore_, exclaiming that she “looked like a young Glenn Close, projecting power over Nemorino as she thrilled with fine coloratura filigree and pure high notes.” In the 2018-19 season, she makes her Wiener Staatsoper debut as Fritzi in the world premiere of Staud’s _Die Weiden_. She makes company debuts with both New Orleans Opera and Opera San Jose in returns to Blondchen in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_, the Seiji Ozawa Music Academy as a guest artist for Frasquita in _Carmen_, and Odyssey Opera as Aithra in _Die ägyptische Helena_.
