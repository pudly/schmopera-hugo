Soprano Kelly Griffin brings her voice of considerable power and warmth to every role she embodies. As Lady Macbeth in Verdi’s *Macbeth*, the New York Observer wrote, “Kelly Griffin sailed through the treacherous role with a lean, cool soprano encompassing both pingy high notes and gutsy plunges into chest register. She commanded the stage with icy presence, betraying the character’s doubts with no more than a glance. Even in the sleepwalking scene, she maintained a dignified, almost formal bearing echoed by her graceful bel canto vocalism.” The South Florida Classical Review hailed her as having “a fierceness matched by a rounded tone and superb coordination with the orchestra”.

In 2015, Ms. Griffin sang her first performance of Aida in Verdi's *Aida* in a concert production at the National Opera Center. Last season, Kelly debuted Lady Macbeth in Verdi’s *Macbeth* with dell’Arte Opera Ensemble. She has recently been heard with Miami Symphony Orchestra as Elettra in an excerpt from *Idomeneo*, the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra in An Evening of Spirituals, the Danbury Symphony Orchestra in Rachmaninov’s *The Bells*, the Kalamazoo College Orchestra in Mahler’s *Songs of a Wayfarer*, and joined the Metropolitan Opera Guild lecture series as Cio-Cio San in Puccini’s *Madama Butterfly* and in 2016 added the title role in Puccini's Manon Lescaut to her repertoire. This past year she made another successful role debut with New Amsterdam Opera as Leonora in *La Forza del Destino*. This season Ms. Griffin will revisit the great scena of Verdi's Lady Macbeth as part of Salt Marsh Opera's "Opera Palooza", and this spring has two role debuts as Amelia in *Un ballo in maschera* and Leonora in *Fidelio*.
