From Canada to Spain to the United States, Canadian pianist Florence Mak has established herself as a versatile musician.  She earned her Bachelor and Master of Music degrees in Piano Performance at the University of Toronto, where she studied with Henri-Paul Sicsic and Jamie Parker.  While in Toronto, she also volunteered at the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, and spent most of her time on the complex-continuing-care unit.
 
Drawing from diverse experiences in summers at SongFest, Vancouver International Song Institute (VISI), Orford, and Burgos International Music Festival, she has ventured into the world of collaborative piano and never turned back.  She is currently pursuing her doctorate at the Eastman School of Music in Piano Accompanying and Chamber Music with Jean Barr.  When she isnâ€™t tickling the ivories, she enjoys cross-stitching, scrapbooking, and volunteering with ROCmusic, an El Sistema-influenced program.
