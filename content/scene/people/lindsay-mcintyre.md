Alberta-born soprano Lindsay McIntyre has been hailed as “a standout” (Ontario Arts Review) for her work in concert and on the stage. Recent concert performances include Buxtehude’s “Membra Jesu Nostri” and the Canadian premier of Craig Hella Johnson’s “Considering Matthew Sheppard” with the Grand Philharmonic Chamber Choir, Handel’s “Dixit Dominus” and BWV 4 & BWV 165 with the Theatre of Early Music, and Steve Reich’s contemporary masterwork “Music for 18 Musicians” with U of T graduate students and faculty for their New Music Festival. 

Lindsay has worked with contemporary music company Soundstreams in their “Electric Messiah,” a reimagined version of Handel’s classic piece. She looks forward to continuing her work with the company with the music of Claude Vivier, performing “Love Songs” and “Musik für das Ende” on an international tour in 2022.  

On the operatic stage, Lindsay has performed the role of Sophie in “Der Rosenkavalier” with Abridged Opera Windsor, First Witch in “Dido and Aeneas” with The Elora Singers, Hero in “Béatrice et Bénédict” with MYOpera, Titania in “The Fairy Queen” on a professional fellowship with the Hawaii Performing Arts Festival, and looks forward to performing Cleopatra in “Giulio Cesare” with U of T Historical Performance this season. 

Equally in demand as a chorister, Lindsay is a core member of the Elora Singers, where she is frequently featured as a soloist. She is also a founding member of Aspirare, a collective of singers dedicated to the performance of contemporary music. Lindsay has also sung regularly with the professional core of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and the Theatre of Early Music. 

Lindsay is a Doctoral Candidate in the Historical Performance department at U of T, where her research focuses on negative self-talk in undergraduate voice majors.
