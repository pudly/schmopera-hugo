Canadian soprano Elizabeth Polese has been praised as "powerful and engaging" [The Globe and Mail], "sparkling" and "delightful", with "power to spare" [Opera Canada]. Recently, she has been a young artist at  l'Atelier Lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal, Tanglewood Music Center, and Detroit Opera. She is the winner of the prestigious 2019-20 Sullivan Foundation Gail Robinson Award for Soprano, and 2021 Hnatyshyn Foundation Developing Artist Award for Classical Voice.

Engagements for the 2022-23 season include appearing in concert with l'Orchestre Classique de Montréal and as Nuria in _Ainadamar_ with Opéra de Montréal.  As a Detroit Opera Resident Artist, Elizabeth covers Marguerite in _Faust_ and Margarita in _Ainadamar_, as well as recital series appearances for Christ Church Cranbrook and The War Memorial. She will also make her role debut as Fiordiligi in _Così fan tutte_ with Great Lakes Chamber Music.  

During the 2021-22 season, Elizabeth toured the province of Québec with harpist Antoine Malette-Chenier with their programme La Lettre du Jardinier. She also joined Tapestry Opera as Robot [Helena] in _RUR: A Torrent of Light_, and as Papagena in Barrie Kosky's _Die Zauberflöte_ with Opéra de Montréal. Elizabeth made her German concert debut at Gewandhaus during BachFest 2022 in a chamber concert including BWV 204 (Ich bin in mir vergnügt) and Webern's _Vier Lieder_. Finally, she made her long-awaited return to Tanglewood Music Center, where she sang the role of Isabel in _Lessons in Love and Violence_ (American premiere, conducted by Sir George Benjamin), to great critical acclaim by the New York Times and Boston Globe. In 2020-21, she was scheduled to sing The Governess in _The Turn of the Screw_ with Opera 5, Mozart's Mass in C with Choral Connection St. Thomas, and Musetta in _La Bohème_ with LAMP, but sadly these engagements were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, she was still able to perform _Messiah_ with l'Orchestre Classique de Montréal at historical Oratoire St-Joseph, which was broadcast worldwide.  

Highlights of Elizabeth's young artist residency at l'Atelier lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal include Alice B. Toklas in the Canadian premiere of _Twenty-Seven_, Miss Jessel in _The Turn of the Screw_ (l'Orchestre de l'Agora) Contessa di Ceprano in _Rigoletto_, and covers of Marzelline in _Fidelio_ (Orchestre Métropolitain), and Agnès in _Written on Skin_. Other engagements of note include _Carmina Burana_ with Kingston Symphony Orchestra, _Exsultate, Jubilate_ with Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, Erste Dame in _Die Zauberflöte_ with Brott Opera, Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ with Opera York, and _Time Cycle_ (Lukas Foss) and _Whitman Settings_ (Oliver Knussen) with Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra.

In 2019, Elizabeth was the winner of the Sullivan Foundation Gail Robinson Award for Soprano, the Hnatyshyn Foundation Award for Classical Voice in 2021, and has won several competitions for her rendition of Mozart’s Exsultate, Jubilate (University of Toronto Concerto Competition, Toronto Mozart Competition, Ottawa Symphony Orchestra Mozart-Sénécal Prize). A proponent of new music as well, Elizabeth regularly performs works by Golijov, Messiaen, Knussen, Foss, Gordon, Freedman, Cage, Crumb, Benjamin, and Stravinsky,  among others.

Ms Polese holds Bachelors and Masters degrees from the University of Toronto, where she studied under the tutelage of celebrated Canadian soprano, Mary Morrison (OC).
