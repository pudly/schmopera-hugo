First Nations mezzo-soprano Marion Newman "has a distinctive, dusky voice that suggests drama with every note" (*Toronto Star*) and has been designated "a show stealer" by *BBC Music Magazine*. 

In her debut in Ireland as *Carmen*, she was widely praised for her “superbly sinuous sexuality” and as “a very exciting new talent” by the *Irish Examiner*. This season, Marion stars as Rosina in Opera Lyra Ottawa’s opening production of Rossini’s beloved *The Barber of Seville*, with the comic action taking place on a 1940’s movie set in Franco’s Spain.

Concert highlights for this accomplished artist include Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with Peterborough Symphony and
Festival of the Sound, Messiah with Symphony Nova Scotia, Elmer Iseler Singers, and Victoria Symphony, Mozart’s *Requiem* with Vancouver Symphony and Rossini’s *Petite Messe Solennelle* with Montreal’s Choeur St-Laurent.

Marion played the vain stepsister Tisbe in Pacific Opera Victoria's *La Cenerentola* and Third Lady in *The Magic Flute* with Vancouver Opera as well as Flora in Opera Lyra Ottawa’s *La Traviata* and the title role in Dvorak’s comic opera *The Devil
and Kate* with Toronto’s Voicebox:Opera in Concert.

Acclaimed for her interpretation of contemporary vocal works, Marion starred in Toronto Masque Theatre’s Dora Award-winning production of *The Lesson of Da Ji* (recorded for Centrediscs), and sang the premiere of Anna Höstman's “Singing the Earth” with Continuum Contemporary Music.

Marion joins the holiday fun with Toronto Masque Theatre in *The Mummer’s Masque*, Dean Burry’s outrageous version of Newfoundland’s 400 year old tradition of music and story-telling.
