American baritone Robert Mellon has been acclaimed by _Opera News_ for having "excellent comic timing" and a "domineering baritone, gleaming like polished copper." During the 2022-2023 season he will be making his house debuts at Lyric Opera of Kansas City as Escamillo in _Carmen_, Tulsa Opera in _L'italiana in Algeri_ as Taddeo, and Opera Tampa as Tonio in _Pagliacci_.

With Livermore Valley Opera he performed the title role in _Gianni Schicchi_ and Simone in _Eine Florentinische Tragödie_ about which the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: "Baritone Robert Mellon was both the musical star of the performance and its dramatic vertex. . .with a steely vocal edge that never interfered with the beauty and flexibility of his singing."
