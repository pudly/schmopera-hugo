American soprano Robin Johannsen came to Europe as a young artist with the Deutsche Oper Berlin and joined the company soon after as a soloist. Her roles there included Susanna (*Le nozze di Figaro*), Norina (*Don Pasquale*), Oscar (*Un ballo in maschera*), and Soeur Constance (*Les dialogues des Carmélites*). After two more years with Oper Leipzig (Gretel, Marzelline, Blonde, Susanna, and Pamina), she began her freelance career in 2008 with a special affinity for the baroque and classical repertoires.

The 2016/2017 season begins with Robin Johannsen singing Rameau arias on tour with Teodor Currentzis and his orchestra MusicAeterna. She will record three new albums: Telemann cantatas with Concerto Melante, the title role in Vinci’s *Didone* with the Lautten Compagney, and Handel’s *Parnasso in festa* with Andrea Marcon and La Cetra Basel. Her season continues with Purcell’s *King Arthur* at the Berliner Staatsoper followed by a debut as Fiordiligi in *Così fan tutte* on tour in Germany, Spain, and Asia with René Jacobs and the Freiburger Barockorchester. The soprano will make her debut in France singing Telemann’s *Brockes Passion* with Raphaël Pichon and his orchestra, Pygmalion at the Paris Philharmonie and five other French cities. In addition, she will sing concerts with leading baroque orchestras such as Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, Concerto Köln, and the Freiburger Barockorchester.

She sang Konstanze on international tour and recorded the role with Jacobs for harmonia mundi. In 2015, she debuted the role of Adina in *L’elisir d’amore* with the Hamburgische Staatsoper and appeared at the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music in Jommeli’s *Don Trastullo* under Alessandro De Marchi.
