The career of British Columbia baritone Justin Welsh has been highlighted by his performances as Crown in Porgy and Bess with Kent Nagano conducting l’Orchestre symphonique de Montréal and Queegueg in the Canadian premiere of _Moby Dick_ for Calgary Opera, praised by the Calgary Herald’s Kenneth Delong, who noted “Justin Welsh brings a finely drawn vocal technique to the part, his voice beautiful throughout the register. Dramatically, too, Welsh’s role was exceptionally well-realized, a major accomplishment as a singing actor.” He has also been heard as Marcello in _La bohème_ for l’Opéra de Montréal and Papageno in _The Magic Flute_ and Figaro in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ for Pacific Opera Victoria. Of particular note was Vivier’s _Musik für das Ende_ produced by Soundstreams, Flight for Pacific Opera Victoria, and he was also heard in Against the Grain’s on-going project, _Bound_.

His 21-22 season includes performances with Tapestry Opera, Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir, White Snake Projects, and joining the Canadian Opera Company for their digital production of Puccini’s _Gianni Schicchi_. Justin joins Pacific Opera Victoria for both digital and in person productions with Raum’s _The Garden of Alice_ and Mozart’s _Don Giovanni_.

Earlier highlights include a variety of repertoire including Baron Duphol in _La traviata_ for Edmonton Opera, Verdi’s _Requiem_ for the Okanagan Symphony, Balthazar in _Amahl and the Night Visitors_ for Calgary Opera, Schubert’s _Fierabras_ for VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert, an Opera Gala for Niagara Symphony and the World Premiere of Barbara Croall’s _miziwie (everywhere)_ for Pax Christi Chorale at Koerner Hall.

A former member of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, he was featured in Ensemble productions of _Swoon_ (World Premiere), _Così fan tutte_ as Guglielmo and _Die Zauberflöte_ as Papageno. On the COC’s mainstage, he has appeared as Fiorello in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_, Dancaire in Carmen and the Herald in _Otello_. Welsh is a past Fellow at Tanglewood’s Summer Institute and has appeared with Tapestry New Opera Works, in the COC’s _Nightingale_ production in Brooklyn, toured with Jeunesses Musicales as Belcore in _L’elisir d’amore_ and sang Slender in VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert’s presentation of Salieri’s rarely heard _Falstaff_. Further credits include _Messiah_ for the Winnipeg, Victoria and Regina symphonies, Fauré’s _Requiem_ with Choeur St. Laurent, _Matthäus Passion_ with the Guelph Chamber Choir and Grand Philharmonic Choir, Beethoven’s Mass in C and Bach’s Magnificat with the Regina Philharmonic Chorus and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Niagara Symphony.

Awards include First Place in the Kurt Weill Competition and an encouragement award from the Louis and Cristina Quilico competition. He holds a Master of Music Degree from the University of British Columbia and participated in young artist programmes in the Czech Republic and in Sulmona, Italy.
