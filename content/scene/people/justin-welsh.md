British Columbia baritone **Justin Welsh**’s career highlights include appearances as Crown in _Porgy and Bess_ with Kent Nagano conducting l’Orchestre symphonique de Montréal and Queegueg in the Canadian premiere of _Moby Dick_ for Calgary Opera, in which he garnered praise from the Calgary Herald’s Kenneth Delong, who noted “Justin Welsh brings a finely drawn vocal technique to the part, his voice beautiful throughout the register. Dramatically, too, Welsh’s role was exceptionally well-realized, a major accomplishment as a singing actor.” Justin has also sung Marcello in _La bohème_ for l’Opéra de Montréal and Papageno in _The Magic Flute_ and Figaro in _Le nozze di Figaro_ for Pacific Opera Victoria. In the realm of newer opera, he has made notable appearances in Vivier’s _Musik für das Ende_ produced by Soundstreams, _Flight_ for Pacific Opera Victoria, and Against the Grain Theatre’s on-going project, _Bound_.

Justin’s 2022-23 season began with Tim Brady’s _Backstage at Carnegie Hall_ in Montreal and continues with Schaunard in Orchestre Philharmonique et Choeur des Mélomanes’ _La bohème,_ followed by a return to Pacific Opera Victoria for Weidhoff in Braunfels’ _Die Vögel_ and to Tapestry Opera as Izunna in _Of the Sea_. His 2021-22 season included performances with Tapestry Opera, Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir, White Snake Projects, and joining the Canadian Opera Company for their digital production of Puccini’s _Gianni Schicchi._ He also joined Pacific Opera Victoria for both digital and in person productions, appearing in Raum’s _The Garden of Alice_ and as Leporello in Mozart’s _Don Giovanni._

Earlier career highlights include Baron Douphol in _La traviata_ for Edmonton Opera, Verdi’s _Requiem_ for the Okanagan Symphony, Balthazar in _Amahl and the Night Visitors_ for Calgary Opera, Schubert’s _Fierabras_ for VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert, an Opera Gala for Niagara Symphony and the World Premiere of Barbara Croall’s _miziwie (everywhere_) for Pax Christi Chorale at Koerner Hall.

A former member of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, Justin was featured in Ensemble productions of _Swoon_ (World Premiere), _Così fan tutte_ as Guglielmo and _Die Zauberflöte_ as Papageno. On the COC’s mainstage, he has appeared as Fiorello in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_, Dancaïre in _Carmen_ and the Herald in _Otello_. Welsh is a past Fellow at the Tanglewood Summer Institute and has appeared in the COC’s _Nightingale_ production in Brooklyn, toured with Jeunesses Musicales as Belcore in _L’elisir d’amore_ and sang Slender in VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert’s presentation of Salieri’s rarely heard _Falstaff_. Further credits include _Messiah_ for the Winnipeg, Victoria and Regina symphonies, Fauré’s _Requiem_ with Choeur St. Laurent, _Matthäus Passion_ with the Guelph Chamber Choir and Grand Philharmonic Choir, Beethoven’s _Mass in C_ and Bach’s _Magnificat_ with the Regina Philharmonic Chorus and Beethoven’s _Symphony No. 9_ with the Niagara Symphony.

Awards include First Place in the Kurt Weill Competition and an encouragement award from the Louis and Cristina Quilico competition. He holds a Master of Music Degree from the University of British Columbia and participated in young artist programmes in the Czech Republic and in Sulmona, Italy.
