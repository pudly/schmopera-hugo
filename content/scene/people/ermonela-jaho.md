The Albanian born soprano Ermonela Jaho is currently booked for years in advance at the most prestigious opera world stages like Royal Opera House in London, Opera National de Paris, Metropolitan of New York, Wiener Staatsoper, Bayeriche Staatsoper, Teatro Real in Madrid, Liceu of Barcelona, La Scala in Milano, Berliner Staatsoper etc.

Her rendition of Violetta at Opera de Bastille earned her standing ovations for all her ten performances there having the critics acknowledge, “To be able to give goosebumps to the Paris opera, that is a challenge!”. A critic attending her Paris *Butterfly* called her “The miracle: Ermonela Jaho”. Her heartfelt interpretation of *Suor Angelica* at Royal Opera House (recorded on DVD) has won “The best DVD of the year” and critical acclaim as “sublime… ethereal” and “Delivered with bone-shaking intensity”. Her *Zaza* recording and performance in London was revered as “a knock-out performance which establishes her as one of the great Verismo interpreters”. Her Madrid, Berlin and Vienna *Traviatas* were considered “dazzling”, “radiant” and “awe-inspiring”. The German press concludes, “An undisputed star who does not sing or play Violetta, she is Violetta”. Currently there are a lot of singers who can retain your attention for ten minutes with their pretty timbre but true artists that can immerse you into the role with their balance of masterful singing technique, sublime acting, elegant scenic presence, irresistible phrasing, while keeping you at the edge of your seat as they bring their spellbound audience to an unimagined intensity come into life once every century.

Her immediate engagements for 2016 are *Manon Lescaut*, at Bayerische Staatsoper; *Madama Butterfly* at Staatsoper Berlin; *Liu* in Staatsoper Stuttgart; Recital at Theatre des Champs-Elysees Paris; *Madama Butterfly*, Orange France; Desdemona, Teatro Real Madrid; Antonia at Opera de Bastille.
