Recognized for her vocalism and artistic commitment in both classical and contemporary operatic repertoire, American soprano Elizabeth Reiter has garnered critical acclaim for her
“rich and silvery” voice (The Boston Globe) and “impressive musical polish” (Opera News), characterizing her as “terrific, a very vital lyric soprano with stellar pitch and attack
wedded to fiercely communicative instincts.” (Opera Magazine)
 
Ms. Reiter is currently a member of the ensemble at Oper Frankfurt, where her performances
have included the title role in *The Cunning Little Vixen*, Anne Trulove in *The Rake’s Progress*, Susanna in *Le Nozze di Figaro*, Nannetta in *Falstaff*, Lauretta in *Gianni Schicchi*, Oscar in *Un ballo in maschera*, Pamina and Erste Dame in *Die Zauberflöte*, the title role in Debussy’s *La Damoiselle Élue*, Orasia in Telemann’s *Orpheus*, Éléonore in Martinu’s *The Tears of the Knife*, soprano soloist in a staged production of Händel’s *Messiah*, and Helmwige & Ortlinde in *The Ring Cycle* (the latter available on DVD in
collaboration with OehmsClassics), among others.
 
Her roles for the 2017-18 Frankfurt season include Armida in *Rinaldo*, Katya in Weinberg's *Die Passagierin*, and Woglinde in *Das Rheingold*, as well as appearances in Claus Guth’s *Die Lustige Witwe* and Barrie Kosky’s *Dido and Aeneas*. Elsewhere in Germany, Ms. Reiter has performed Susanna with Oper Stuttgart and Najade in *Ariadne auf Naxos* with the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf.

In the United States, Ms. Reiter received international attention for her portrayal of Aphrodite in the American premiere of HW Henze’s *Phaedra* with Opera Philadelphia, where she has also appeared as *The Cunning Little Vixen*, Blonde in *Die Entführung aus dem Serail*, and Amor in *Orphée et Eurydice*. Other notable US appearances include Zerlina in *Don Giovanni* under the baton of James Levine (Tanglewood Music Center), Pamina in *The Magic Flute* and Flora *The Turn of the Screw* (Chicago Opera Theater), Adele in *Die Fledermaus* (Opera Memphis), La libellule in *L’Enfant et les Sortiléges* with Lorin Maazel (Castleton Festival), Adele in the American premiere of Michael Berkeley’s *Jane Eyre* (Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Sir Colin Graham directing), and Amina in *La Sonnambula*, Corinna in *Il viaggio a Reims*, and Zerlina (Curtis Opera Theatre).
 
A frequent interpreter of new music, Ms. Reiter made her professional debut at the age of 16 as Young Maria Celeste in the world premiere of Philip Glass and Mary Zimmerman’s *Galileo Galilei* (Chicago’s Goodman Theatre, Brooklyn Academy of Music, and London’s Barbican Center). She later returned to the Goodman Theatre as Polyxena in Zimmerman’s staging of Seneca’s *Trojan Women*, singing an aria specially composed by Philip Glass.

Apart from the opera stage, Elizabeth has collaborated with composer Libby Larsen on her
*Songs from Letters* at the Ravinia Music Festival and with composer André Previn on his *Sallie Chisum remembers Billy the Kid* both at the Tanglewood Music Center and in a
televised performance in Tokyo with the composer at the piano.
 
As a concert performer, Ms. Reiter has appeared on the stage of the Frankfurt Alte Oper in 2017 as soprano soloist in Mozart’s *Requiem*. She recently made her debut with Frankfurt’s Ensemble Modern singing Sofia Gubaidulina’s *Hommage à T.S. Eliot*. Elizabeth has also been heard as soprano soloist in Weill’s *Royal Palace* at the Bard Music Festival with the American Symphony Orchestra, Mozart’s *Requiem* with the Curtis Sinfonietta, Vaughan Williams’ *Dona Nobis Pacem* with the Chautauqua Music Festival Orchestra and Mahler’s 'Symphony No. 4' with the Manhattan School of Music Philharmonia.
