American soprano Marnie Breckenridge is captivating international audiences with roles ranging from the Baroque and bel canto to Modern. Her passionate interpretations of contemporary works include: Mother in _Dog Days_ by David T. Little where the _NY Times_ praised Breckenridge’s “lovely soprano” and TimeOut Magazine voted it Best Opera 2012 (premier-Montclair Peak Performances, Los Angeles Opera 2015, Prototype Festival 2016, Ft. Worth Opera 2015,) Sierva Maria in Peter Eötvös’s _Love and Other Demons_ (Glyndebourne Festival Opera), La Princesse in Philip Glass’ _Orphée_, title role in Milhaud’s Médée, and Margarita Xirgu in Golijov’s _Ainamandar_ (Opera Parallèle), Ruth in Luna Pearl Woolf’s _The Pillar_ (Julian Wachner and Washington Chorus), her Berkeley Symphony debut in Chin’s _Cantantrix Sopranica_ with Kent Nagano and her Ravinia Festival debut in Jake Heggie’s _To Hell and Back_ with Philharmonia Baroque, co-staring Patti LuPone. Of her performance at Ravinia noted by reviewer John Von Rein, "she sounded as gorgeous as she looked, achieving both lyrical poignancy and dramatic power" (The Chicago Tribune). Her superb acting and musicianship have brought her into the worlds of television and voice-over as well as theatre where she recently composed the vocal lines for and sang the lead in WAKE  an original production with director Mei Ann Teo (PUC Alumnus) and composer Jon Bernstein at the Connelly Theatre in New York.

Breckenridge made her Carnegie Hall debut singing the soprano solos in Mozart’s _Coronation Mass_ last spring. Other recent concert work includes soprano soloist in two special _Sound Box_ performances (San Francisco Symphony), _Ein Deutsches Requiem_ and _Carmina Burana_ (SF Choral Society at Davies Symphony Hall), Dallapiccolla’s _Partitia_ and Petrassi’s _Magnificat_ (2016) and _Berg in Vienna_ (2010) concerts (Bard Music Festival), Barber’s _Knoxville: Summer of 1915_ and Mahler’s 4th Symphony (Napa Symphony and Pacific Symphony) as well as the _Bachianas Brazileras_ and _Chicago Songs_ written for her by Kurt Erickson (Sacramento Philharmonic). As the 2013 recipient of the Fanfare Award for “Alumni of the Year” at the San Francisco Conservatory, Ms. Breckenridge gave a recital honoring Bay Area composers (Heggie, Mollicone, Conte, Garner, Erickson, Getty) and their works accompanied by Kristin Pankonin.

Other opera roles include _Lucia di Lammermoor_ (Mobile Opera and Indianapolis Opera), Yum Yum in THE MIKADO (Arizona Opera), Gretel in Hänsel und Gretel (Indianapolis Opera and Arizona Opera), Papagena in _Die Zauberflöte_ and Olga in _The Merry Widow_ (San Francisco Opera), Pamina in _Die Zauberflöte_ (Indianapolis Opera), Gilda in _Rigoletto_ and Emily in _Our Town_ (Festival Opera), Nelle in _Crysalis_ (West Edge Opera). She had regularly performed under the baton of Lorin Maazel as Lucia in Britten’s _Rape of Lucretia_ at his Castleton Foundation and on tour. Breckenridge is a featured soloist on the 2012 New World Records’ album of Victor Herbert songs and recently made her European and Asian debuts as Cunegonde in _Candide_ (Prague State Opera then in Robert Carsen’s production with the English National Opera and on tour in Japan) where her performances were reviewed “note perfect” (Prague Post) and “simply terrific” (Opera Magazine, UK).
