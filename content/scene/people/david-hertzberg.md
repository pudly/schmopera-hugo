Hailed as “opulently gifted” by Opera News and “utterly original” by *The New York Times*, the music of David Hertzberg (b. 1990, Los Angeles) is swiftly garnering recognition. 

Highlights of his 2016-2017 season include performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and the Resonant Bodies Festival in New York, as well as performances of *for none shall gaze upon the Father and live* with the Kansas City Symphony, *Spectre of the Spheres* with the North State Symphony, and the premiere of a new orchestral work, chamber symphony (2017), with the American Composers Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Upcoming projects include a new opera, *The Wake World*, co-presented by Opera Philadelphia and the Barnes Foundation, to be premiered at the Barnes on Opera Philadelphia’s inaugural Festival O17 in September of 2017, as well as a new work for cellist Jay Campbell and pianist Conor Hanick commissioned by the Fromm Foundation of Harvard University. 

Highlights of his 2015-2016 season included new works for violinist In Mo Yang and pianist Steven Lin, both of which premiered on the Concert Artists Guild series at Carnegie Hall, as well as a large-scale concert work, Sunday Morning, for New York City Opera, which was premiered by Sarah Shafer and the New York City Opera Orchestra under the baton of Gil Rose at Lincoln Center, and a one act chamber opera, *The Rose Elf*, which was premiered on Opera Philadelphia’s Double Exposure program. He was also appointed Composer in Residence for Opera Philadelphia and Music-Theatre Group, a post that he will hold through the end of the 2017-2018 season.

His work has been featured at festivals including Tanglewood, Aspen, and the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, and performed at venues including Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, and Carnegie Hall.

Among his recent distinctions are a Fromm Commission from Harvard University, the Underwood Emerging Composer Commission from the American Composers Orchestra, the inaugural Catherine Doctorow Prize from Gotham Chamber Opera, a Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an Aaron Copland Award from Copland House, the William Schuman Prize and Carlos Surinach Commission from BMI, two ASCAP Morton Gould Awards, a Jerome Fund Commission from the American Composers Forum, and the Arthur Friedman Prize from the Juilliard School.
