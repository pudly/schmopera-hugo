The performances of _Tannhäuser_ with Apotheosis Opera were a success, and it was noted that "Tenor Nicholas Simpson was a full-throated hero who carried the role from beginning to end without strain." (Voce di Meche). Mr Simpson has also appeared as Peter Quint in Britten's _The Turn of the Screw_ and Rodolfo in _La bohème_ with Hub Opera.
