Baritone John Brancy is on the verge of an exciting and diverse performing career, and has been hailed by the New York Times as “a vibrant, resonant presence”. He is the 2015 Jensen Foundation Vocal Competition Winner and the 2013 Winner of the Marilyn Horne Song Competition. 

John Brancy begins the 2015-2016 season with a significant debut with the Glyndebourne Festival Opera Tour, as Malatesta in *Don Pasquale*. He also debuts with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as Harlekin in *Ariadne auf Naxos*, as well as Pacific Opera Victoria, as Demetrius in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*. He returns to Carnegie Hall in recital as part of their “Evening of Song Series,” as well as Oper Frankfurt, as Morales/Dancairo in Carmen. His concert engagements include the Boston Symphony Chamber Players, Edmonton Symphony, St. John’s College Concert Series, Chamber Music Society of Palm Beach, and Opera America’s 2016 Emerging Artist Recital Series in conjunction with the Jensen Foundation. Future seasons include performances with the Opera National de Lorraine and the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Russia.

Last season, John Brancy’s debuts included: The Opera San Antonio as the title role in Tobias Picker’s *The Fantastic Mr. Fox* along with a gala appearance at the opening of San Antonio’s new Tobin Center; Edmonton Opera as Papageno in *Die Zauberflöte*; Opera Lyra Ottawa as Figaro in *Le nozze di Figaro*; and Opera Saratoga as Dandini in *La Cenerentola*. His concert engagements included his debut with Musica Sacra in Handel’s *Messiah* at Carnegie Hall, where he also performed a recital with pianist Ken Noda later in the season for “The Song Continues”. He also appeared with New York Festival of Song (NYFOS) performing at Merkin Hall with pianist Steven Blier. He made his recital debut at the Kennedy Center with Vocal Arts DC, and reprised the same program with CAIC (Collaborative Arts Institute of Chicago), and Société d’art vocal de Montréal in collaboration with pianist Peter Dugan.

During the 2013-2014 season, Mr. Brancy made important debuts at Oper Frankfurt as Sonora in *La fanciulla del West*, Gotham Chamber Opera in Charpentier’s *La descente d’Orphée aux Enfers*, and Pacific Opera Victoria as Harlekin in *Ariadne auf Naxos*. Mr. Brancy’s concert and recital engagements for the year included performances with the Saskatoon and Regina Symphonies, San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Brooklyn Art Song Society, and Carnegie Hall.

During the 2012-2013 season, Mr. Brancy made his debut with the Dresden Semperoper, singing the role of Fiorello in Rossini’s *Il Barbiere di Siviglia*, performed in a new production of John Adams’ *I Was Looking at the Ceiling, and Then I Saw the Sky* with Paris’ Theatre du Chatelet, and finished his graduate degree at The Juilliard School as Harasta in *The Cunning Little Vixen*. Mr. Brancy closed the season performing the role of Papageno in *Die Zauberflöte* at the prestigious Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara where he was described by Opera News as having “impeccable timing, dynamic physicality and robust voice.”

While still an undergraduate student at The Juilliard School, Mr. Brancy made his Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall debuts as the Baritone soloist in Fauré’s Requiem, Mozart’s Coronation Mass, and Schubert’s Mass in G. He was the winner of the 2010 Juilliard School Honors Recital Competition and in the following year made his Alice Tully Hall debut, with pianist, Brian Zeger.  Mr. Brancy is a recent winner of the Sullivan Foundation Grand Prize and career grants, 1st Prize at the Classical Singer Magazine Competition, and the Gold Award for Voice at the YoungArts Foundation competition. He was a 2nd Place winner in the Gerda Lissner and Liederkranz competitions, and a laureate of the 2012 Montreal International Music Competition.
