Simon Keenlyside was born in London. He made his operatic debut at the Hamburg State Opera as Count Almaviva _Le Nozze di Figaro_. Simon appears in all the world’s great opera houses and has a particularly close association with the Metropolitan Opera New York, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, and the Bavarian and Vienna State Opera houses where his roles include Prospero _The Tempest_, Posa _Don Carlo_, Germont Père _La Traviata_, Papageno _The Magic Flute_, Count Almaviva and the title roles in _Don Giovanni_, _Eugene Onegin_, _Pelléas et Mélisande_, _Wozzeck_, _Billy Budd_, _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_ and _Rigoletto_.

Simon enjoys extensive concert work and has sung under the baton of many of the worlds’ leading conductors, appearing with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the City of Birmingham, London Symphony, Philharmonia and Cleveland Orchestras, and the Czech, Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras.

A renowned recitalist Simon appears regularly in the world’s major recital venues. He has recorded a disc of Schumann Lieder with Graham Johnson and four recital discs with Malcolm Martineau, of Schubert, Strauss, Brahms, and most recently, an English song disc, _Songs of War_ which won the Solo Vocal Award at the 2012 Gramophone Awards.

He has also recorded Britten’s _War Requiem_ with the London Symphony Orchestra under Noseda, Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_ under McCreesh, _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_ under Rattle, the title role in _Macbeth_ under Gardner, the title role in _Don Giovanni_ under Abbado, Carmina Burana under Thielemann, Marcello _La Bohème_ under Chailly, the title role in _Billy Budd_ under Hickox, Papageno _The Magic Flute_ under Mackerras, Count Almaviva in the Grammy award-winning _Le Nozze di Figaro_ under Jacobs, and Prospero in Adès’ _The Tempest_ which won the Best Opera Recording (Grammy Awards 2014) and Music DVD Recording of the Year (Echo Klassik Awards 2014).

Simon’s operatic plans this season include his first Tonio _Pagliacci_ and Ford _Falstaff_ at the Royal Opera House; Golaud and Count Almaviva at the Vienna State Opera; as well as the title roles of Macbeth in Munich, Rigoletto at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and Don Giovanni in Geneva. On the concert platform, he will perform Adès’ _Totentanz_ with the Czech Philharmonic and the Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester Berlin under the composer’s baton. In recital, he will appear in London, Paris, Vienna, Graz, Brussels and New York with Malcolm Martineau. He will be joined by a small piece jazz band for his programme _Blue skies - Songlines to American Music_ at the Vienna Konzerthaus.
