Keturah Stickann’s work has been seen in countless opera houses across the United States and Canada, as well as in Chile, Japan, France, Germany, Hungary, and Australia. A champion of new American opera, she has worked extensively with director and librettist, Leonard Foglia, helping to bring new operas to the stage by Ricky Ian Gordon, Jennifer Higdon, Jose “Pepe” Martinez, and Jake Heggie & Gene Scheer. Her work on the premieres of _Moby-Dick_ (2010), and _It’s A Wonderful Life_ (2016) prompted Jake Heggie to ask her to helm the premiere of his newest opera, _If I Were You_ (2019), at the Merola Opera Program. 

In addition, she has directed works by Mr. Gordon (_Orpheus and Euridice_), Laura Kaminsky and Mark Campbell (_As One_), Anthony Davis and Allan Havis (_Lilith_), and Robert Aldridge and Herschel Garfein (_Sister Carrie_).

Ms. Stickann has directed many new productions including _Candide_ (Michigan Opera Theatre), _La clemenza di Tito_ (Opera in the Heights), _Dialogues of the Carmelites_ (Rutgers University), _Don Giovanni_ (Janiec Opera Company), _Don Pasquale_ (Opera in the Heights), _L’Elisir d’amore_ (Opera Birmingham), _L’enfant et les sortileges_ (Opera Steamboat), Jonathan Dove’s _Flight_ (Opera Fayetteville), _Macbeth_ (Kentucky Opera), _Norma_ (Opera Southwest), Monteverdi’s _L’Orfeo_ (Chautauqua Opera), _Pelléas et Mélisande_ (West Edge Opera), _Rusalka_ (Madison Opera), _The Seven Deadly Sins/Pagliacci_ (Virginia Opera), _Tosca_ (Knoxville Opera), _La tragédie de Carmen_ (Janiec Opera Company), and _La Traviata_ (Knoxville Opera, Chautauqua Opera), among others.

Born and raised in the Midwest, Ms. Stickann had an early career as a classical and contemporary dancer, dancing extensively in opera toward the end of her performing career, most notably at San Diego Opera, Michigan Opera Theatre, New York City Opera, and Chicago Opera Theater. Her background in dance and theater has made her a sought-after movement coach, working with young artists at the La Jolla Playhouse, the Brevard Music Center, Stephen’s College, DePaul University, Opera Memphis, The San Diego Opera, and Virginia Opera.
