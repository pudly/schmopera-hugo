Italian bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni has established himself as one of the most captivating and versatile singers performing today. Since his debut at age 26 with the Vienna Philharmonic at the Salzburg Festival, led by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Mr. Pisaroni has performed at many of the world’s leading opera houses, concert halls and festivals.

Following a series of critically acclaimed performances of Leporello in Mozart’s *Don Giovanni* at the Salzburg Festival, Pisaroni begins the 2014/2015 season as Count Almaviva in Mozart’s *Le nozze di Figaro* at the Teatro Real in Madrid; a role that he will later perform at the Wiener Staatsoper and the San Francisco Opera. Mr. Pisaroni will also sing the title role in *Le nozze di Figaro* at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Münich and the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden this season. He returns to the Metropolitan Opera stage to sing Leporello in Mozart’s *Don Giovanni*, led by Alan Gilbert, and he performs the role of Enrico VIII in Donizetti’s *Anna Bolena* at the Opernhaus Zürich and the Wiener Staatsoper.
