After her debut in Calgary Opera’s 2017 production of John Estacio’s *Filumena*, the Calgary Herald declared that the father of the leading role “…was nicely matched by warm-toned Morgan Traynor…” in the role of Mamma Costanzo. Praised for her genuine characterization and meaningful artistry, Ms. Traynor will sing Fiordiligi this year in Calgary Opera’s concert performance of *Così fan tutte* and Second Lady in Brott Opera’s production of *The Magic Flute* after having completed a transition to soprano during her second season in Calgary Opera’s Emerging Artist Development Program. Recent commitments include covering Rosina for Calgary Opera’s production of *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, performing the title role in Calgary Opera’s Opera in the Village production of *Cinderella*, which used both the music of Rossini and Massenet, as well as singing Mercédès in Brott Opera’s production of *Carmen*. She completed a Masters in Music Performance at the University of Western Ontario studying with Torin Chiles and Patricia Green, and received her Bachelor of Music from Mount Allison University while studying with Monette Gould. Ms. Traynor’s past roles include Véronique in Dr. Miracle, part of Calgary Opera’s “Christmas at the Opera”, Mrs. Quickly in UWOpera’s *Falstaff*, the title roles of Cesare (*Giulio Cesare*) with Summer Opera Lyric Theatre, Isabella (*L’Italiana in Algeri*) with La Musica Lirica in Novafeltria, Italy, The Child (*L’enfant et les sortilèges*) with UWOpera, and Mother (*Hänsel und Gretel*) with L’Atelier d’opéra de l’Université de Moncton
