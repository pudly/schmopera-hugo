German American mezzo-soprano, Siena Licht Miller, is quickly making a name for herself in both the opera and concert worlds. After her professional debut as Second Lady in *Die Zauberflote* with Opera Philadelphia, Siena returns this season in two recitals as a part of their ground-breaking O18 Festival and Hermia *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*. This summer, Siena was a member of Santa Fe Opera’s Apprentice Program, covering Kitty Oppenheimer *Doctor Atomic* and Suzuki *Madame Butterfly*. Highlights for the 2018/2019 season include the title role in *Dido and Aeneas*, Dinah *Trouble in Tahiti*, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 Oregon Symphony, and a recital with the Carnegie Hall Citywide Concert Series, which she will take on tour to the United Kingdom and Germany.
 
Recent engagements included the title role in *L'enfant et les sortilèges* with the Aspen Music Festival, and appearances with Curtis Opera Theatre in the title role in *The Rape of Lucretia*, Kitty Oppenheimer in *Doctor Atomic*, Baba in *The Medium*. In addition, Siena appeared in concert as the Alto soloist in Beethoven Symphony No. 9 with Symphony in C. Ms. Miller has worked with master artists such as Renée Fleming, Robert Spano, Placido Domingo and Graham Johnson. Invited by Ms. Marilyn Horne, Siena had the privilege of participating in the legendary mezzo’s final year of leading *The Song Continues* series at Carnegie Hall this past January. 

Ms. Miller is an alumna of the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, the Gerdine Young Artist Program at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, the Chautauqua Institute, and the Aspen Music Festival. Originally from Portland, Oregon, Siena entered the Curtis Institute of Music in 2016 and is currently based in Philadelphia.
