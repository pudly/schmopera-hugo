Soprano Leigh-Ann Allen is known for her versatility in many vocal genres and has developed significant roles in both modern and classic soprano repertoire. Most recently in Italy she performed Suor Genovieffa in Puccini's _Suor Angelica_. Other credits include Rose in _Street Scene_, Jeanette in the Canadian debut of _Too Many Sopranos_, Poppea in _L'incoronazione di Poppea_, and has sung with Pacific Opera Victoria in _Madama Butterfly_. In demand as a solo artist, Ms Allen has sung the Fauré _Requiem_, Schubert _Ständchen_, and Ligeti's challenging chamber work _Aventures_, and _Messiaen's Poèmes pour Mi_.

Leigh-Ann has worked in masterclasses with esteemed musicians such as Martin Katz, Richard Miller, Stuart Hamilton, Adrianne Pieczonka, Tom Diamond, and John Hess. Ms Allen received first place in both the Louis Marshall Voice Competition and Conservatory Canada's Young Artists' Competition. She was a finalist for the London Concerto Competition, London Music Scholarship, and London Opera Guild Scholarship recipient. This season, Leigh-Ann will be singing the premier of Canadian composer Andrew Ager's song cycle _Voglio_ in Toronto. Upcoming debuts include Gilda in _Talk Opera_, Susanna in _Il segreto di Susanna_ with Opera Five Toronto, a Nymph in _Armida_ with Toronto Opera in Concert, and Clo-Clo in _The Merry Widow_ with Toronto Operetta Theatre.

Leigh-Ann recently finished with her Masters at the University of Western Ontario. After graduation Leigh-Ann turned her focus to co-found the Amici School of Music for young children in Toronto with fellow singer Michelle Garlough, with which she is still passionately involved. Leigh-Ann enjoys the challenge of balancing her solo career with her passion for teaching and managing a music school.
