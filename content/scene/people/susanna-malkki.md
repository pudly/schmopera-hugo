Susanna Mälkki has recently been appointed Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, effective from the 2016/17 season.

A much sought-after artist on the international conducting circuit, Susanna Mälkki’s versatility and broad repertoire have taken her to symphony and chamber orchestras, contemporary music ensembles and opera houses across the world.

As a guest conductor at the highest level in both Europe and North America, Mälkki’s recent highlights include returns to the San Francisco Symphony (where she returns again in autumn 2015), Los Angeles Philharmonic and Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and the Aldeburgh festival. Notable recent debuts include The Philadelphia, Cleveland and New York Philharmonic orchestras, Chamber Orchestra of Europe and Teatro La Fenice.

Summer 2015 saw Mälkki return to the BBC Proms conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Highlights in 2015/16 include returns to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, New World Symphony, Bayerischer Rundfunk, Wiener Symphoniker at the Bregenzer Festival, London Sinfonietta and Oslo Philharmonic orchestras. She will also make her debut with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Orquesta y Coro Nacionales de España in November 2015.

A renowned opera conductor, Mälkki performed *Le nozze di Figaro* with the Finnish National Opera in August 2014 and followed this with her Staatsoper Hamburg debut, conducting a revival of Janáček’s *Jenůfa*. In 2011 Mälkki made her debut at Teatro alla Scala, Milan – the first woman to conduct a production there in the company’s history – and returned in 2014.
