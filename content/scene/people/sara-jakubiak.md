American soprano Sara Jakubiak has been praised by the New York Times for her “plush-voiced, impressive soprano” and by Opera News as a “talented, highly musical singer.”

Jakubiak continued as a member of the ensemble at Oper Frankfurt for the 2016/17 season, where she sang leading roles in two new productions: Tatyana in *Eugene Onegin*, conducted by Sebastian Weigle, and Marie in Krenek’s *Der Diktator*. She was seen in Harry Kupfer’s production of *The Gambler*, conducted by Weigle, and Vaughan-Williams’ *Sea Symphony* at the Grant Park Musical Festival in Chicago, conducted by Carlos Kalmar. Jakubiak also returned to the Hamburg Opera for her role debut in Christoph Loy’s new production of Strauss’s *Daphne*. She will soon record Schönberg’s *Erwartung* with the Bergen Philharmonic and Edward Gardner for release on Chandos Records. In future seasons, Jakubiak will return to Oper Frankfurt as Ellen Orford in *Peter Grimes* and Freia in *Das Rheingold*, and she will make both her role and house debut as the title role in *Das Wunder der Heliane* at the Deutsche Oper Berlin.

In recent seasons, Ms. Jakubiak has made many significant debuts: Eva in a new production of *Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg* at the Bayersiche Staatsoper, under Kirill Petrenko; Rosalinde in *Die Fledermanus* and Agathe in a new production of *Der Freischütz* at the Semperoper Dresden, the latter conducted by Christian Thielemann and released commercially on DVD by Unitel; Marie in *Die tote Stadt* at the Hamburg Opera; Polina in Andrea Breth’s new production of Prokofiev’s *The Gambler* at the Dutch National Opera, under Marc Albrecht; Elsa von Brabant in a new production of *Lohengrin* at Oper Graz; and Marie in *Wozzeck* at the English National Opera, conducted by Edward Gardner. In Frankfurt, she has been seen as Lina in a new production of *Stiffelio*, Marie/Marietta in *Die tote Stadt*, Alice Ford in *Falstaff*, Prima Donna/Ariadne in *Ariadne auf Naxos*, The Goose Girl in Humperdinck’s *Königskinder*, and Marta in a new production of Weinberg’s *Die Passagierin*, both in Frankfurt and in Vienna at the Wiener Festwochen.

Sara Jakubiak’s concert performances include her Israel Philharmonic debut with Zubin Mehta as Rosalinde in *Die Fledermaus*, Emma in Schubert’s *Fierrabras* and Schumann’s “Scenes from Goethe’s Faust” with the American Symphony Orchestra, the Governess in Britten’s *The Turn of the Screw* with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Mozart concert arias with the Colorado Symphony, and concert performances of Howard Hanson’s lyrical opera Merry Mount with the Rochester Philharmonic, under Michael Christie at Carnegie Hall, originally commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera. She has also performed Penderecki’s *Polish Requiem* with Orquesta Sinfónica de la Juventud Venezolana Simón Bolívar in Caracas, conducted by Krzysztof Penderecki, and Fiora in a concert version of Montemezzi’s *L’amore dei tre re* with the Polish Radio Orchestra in Warsaw, under the baton of Lucasz Borowitcz, which was recently released on CD. Ms. Jakubiak is featured on the Naxos label’s eight-volume collection of Charles Ives songs in the series “American Classics”.

Other recent engagements include her debut at the New York City Opera as Dede in a new, ground-breaking production of Bernstein’s *A Quiet Place* by Christopher Alden, her debut with the Minnesota Opera as Catherine Earnshaw in Herrmann’s *Wuthering Heights*, Beatrice in Jake Heggie’s *Three Decembers* alongside celebrated mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade at the Chicago Opera Theater, and Countess Almaviva in *Le nozze di Figaro* at the Seoul Arts Center in Korea.

Ms. Jakubiak holds master’s degrees from both Yale University and the Cleveland Institute of Music. She was a Regional Finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and was also the recipient of the Judith Raskin Memorial Award from Santa Fe Opera.
