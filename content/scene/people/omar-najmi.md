Tenor Omar Najmi is a familiar face on the stages of Boston, where he makes his home.  As an Emerging Artist with Boston Lyric Opera, Omar has appeared in over ten productions, including his critically acclaimed performances as Vanya Kudrjas in Katya Kabanova.  Omar is a recent recipient of the Harold Norblom Award, awarded by Opera Colorado, where he completed a residency as a Young Artist in the 2016/2017 season.  His appearances with Opera Colorado include Joe in _La Fanciulla del West_, Normanno in _Lucia di Lammermoor_, and Edgardo in the _Lucia di Lammermoor_ Student Matinee.

Off of the operatic stage, Omar has maintained an active concert career.  Most recently, he collaborated with soprano Laura Intravia and pianist Brendon Shapiro in the creation and performance of "An American Timeline," a multimedia recital program exclusively featuring works by American composers.  He has also been a featured soloist with the touring concert "Video Games Live" in Boston, Newark, and Denver (with the Colorado Symphony).

Omar has been a Young Artist with Chautauqua Opera, Opera Saratoga, Opera North, and Opera NEO.  He holds a M.M. from Boston University, and a B.M. from Ithaca College.
