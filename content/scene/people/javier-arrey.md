Heralded as one of the most sought after and versatile baritones of the emerging generation, Chilean-American baritone Javier Arrey recently did his Metropolitan Opera debut as Schaunard (_La Bohème_) in the classic Franco Zeffirelli production and joined the roster of The Metropolitan Opera; he also did an acclaimed debut at the Wiener Staatsoper as Marcello in _La Bohème_.

Engagements in recent seasons include, among others: Garibaldo (_Rodelinda_) and Sharpless (_Madama Butterfly_) at the Teatro Municipal de Santiago, Valdeburgo (_La Straniera_) at Washington Concert Opera, Marcello (_La Bohème_) at the Washington National Opera, Giovanni (_Don Giovanni_) at the Estates Theater in Prague and Castleton Festival, Alphonse (_La Favorite_) with Washington Concert Opera under Antony Walker. Following an acclaimed debut as Jago (_Otello_) at the Castleton Festival under Lorin Maazel, a performance _The Washington Post_ described as “menaced and connived but \[Arrey\] did so subtly and with a voice so lovely to listen to that his scheming seemed all the more threatening.”; Praises came also from Mo. Lorin Maazel who published: “Jago was stunningly sung and acted by Javier Arrey \[who\] manages to give shape to the jealous demon within Otello”.

Other highlights from recent seasons include: Valentin (_Faust_), Sharpless (_Madama Butterfly_), Malatesta (_Don Pasquale_) and Lescaut (_Manon Lescaut_) at Washington National Opera, Il Marito (_Amelia al Ballo_) at Opera de Monte-Carlo and Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia in Valencia, Silvio (_I Pagliacci_) at the NCPA Mumbai under Antonello Allemandi, Giorgio (_Il Postino_) and Garibaldo (_Rodelinda_) at the Teatro Municipal de Santiago.

On CD, Mr.Arrey can be heard as Lescaut on the recording of Puccini’s _Manon Lescaut_ for Decca Classics alongside Andrea Bocelli and Ana Maria Martinez and under the baton of Mo. Plácido Domingo.

In addition to his work on the opera stage Arrey has proved to be a world-class interpreter of the concert repertoire most recently performing _Carmina Burana_ in Europe and Dvorák’s _Biblical Songs_ & _Gypsy Songs_ in Czech Republic. His repertoire includes Fauré’s _Requiem_, Bach _St.John Passion_ BWV 245, Bach _Weihnachtsoratorium_ BWV 248, Bach Cantata BWV 82, Schumann’s _Dichterliebe_, Brahms’ _Ein deutsches Requiem_ and Mahler’s Lieder _Eines Fahrenden Gesellen_, among others.

In 2017, Mr. Arrey received the “Congressional Medal of Honor” at the National Congress of Chile in recognition of his artistic career and his social labor bringing the Opera to populations who have no access to live performances. On 2011 Javier Arrey was the winner of the CulturArte Prize at Operalia Competition in Moscow and on 2009 he was finalist at the Cardiff Singer of the World competition (Song prize). Mr.Arrey is a graduate of The Washington National Opera’s Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist program.

Future engagements include, among others: Enrico (_Lucia di Lammemoor_) at Teatro Municipal de Chile, Riccardo (_I Puritani_), Bach cantata BWV 82 and his return to the Metropolitan Opera House in Puccini’s productions of _Turandot_ and _La Bohème_.
