Eden Tremayne is a Canadian Opera singer recognized for her heartfelt singing and dynamic stage portrayals. Ms. Tremayne is returning for her third year as a McPhee Artist for **Calgary** **Opera**’s 2021/22 season. This season on the mainstage Eden will sing le Feu, le Rossignol and la Bergère in Ravel’s _L’Enfant et les Sortilèges_ as well as cover both Valencienne in _The Merry Widow_ and Violetta in _La Traviata_.

In the 2019/2020 season, Eden had her **Calgary Opera** mainstage debut as Clotilde in Bellini’s _Norma_ and covered Musetta in Puccini’s _La bohème._ She was set to perform the role of Najade in Strauss’s _Ariadne auf Naxos_, as well as Hero in _Béatrice et Bénédict_ but those shows were cancelled due to the covid-19 pandemic.

During the 2020/2021 season, **Calgary Opera** produced a series of digital performances in which Ms. Tremayne sang noteworthy arias and songs such as Richard Strauss’s “Presentation of the Rose” and Schumann’s “Widmung”. She also performed the role of Gretel in Calgary Opera’s digital release of Humperdinck’s _Hansel and Gretel_. **Calgary Opera** also hosted a four-month long workshop series titled “Opera Labs” in which four new Canadian works were realized by the Emerging Artist Ensemble as well as artists, composers, pianists, librettists and dramaturges from across Canada. During this time, **Calgary Opera** enlisted the help of Pluto Pictures to create four short films that capture the trials, tribulations and triumphs of creating new works of opera in the midst of a global pandemic, which can be viewed free at calgaryopera.com. Ms. Tremayne particularly loved workshopping and performing the role of Svetlana in John Estacio’s new work _The Cipher Clerk_ and Lola in Samy Moussa’s _Vastation_.

Some of Ms. Tremayne’s other notable operatic performances include performing the role of Violetta in Verdi’s _La Traviata_ while torturing Central and Eastern Canada as part of **Jeunesses Musicales du Canada**’s Emerging Artists. The Fort Town Concert Association declared, “La Traviata lives or dies on the strength of the soprano who sings Violetta… From her first convincing consumptive cough to her dramatic death at the end, Ms. Tremayne was the star. There were cheers and a standing ovation for her performance.”

Ms. Tremayne was also a member of the Yulanda M. Faris Young Artist Program at **Vancouver Opera** where she performed roles including Kate Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_, Countess Ceprano and the Page in Verdi’s _Rigoletto_, Lucinda in the Canadian premiere of Nico Muhly’s _Dark Sisters_, and the role of Soprano in Tom Johnson’s _The Four Note Opera_.

Ms. Tremayne was also an Apprentice Artist at the **San Diego Opera** for two seasons where she had her mainstage debut as Countess Cepraro. She understudied the roles of Gilda in Verdi’s _Rigoletto_, Susanna in Mozart’s _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and Frasquita in Bizet’s _Carmen._ Eden also performed across San Diego County in dozens of staged concerts with her fellow San Diego Opera Apprentice Artists. In addition, she made her **Bodhi Tree Concerts** debut as Rowan in Benjamin Britten’s _The Little Sweep_ and performed again with them the following season as Mabel in _The Pirates of Penzance_.

Highlights on the concert stage include singing the role of soprano soloist from Ralph Vaughan Williams’ _Dona nobis pacem_ with **The La Jolla Symphony and Chorus** for which the San Diego Tribune praised her as “an angelic soprano.” Ms. Tremayne also performed the role of Lisa in a concert version of Lehar’s _The Land of Smiles_ with the **Vancouver Symphony Orchestra**, and again joined **the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra** with the **Vancouver Bach Choir** as a soloist for their Verdi/Wagner Bicentennial celebration concerts. She was also a member of a trio with San Diego Symphony’s Principal Bassist, Jeremy Kurtz-Harris and solo recitalist and collaborative pianist, Ines Irawati in which they performed house concerts throughout the San Diego area.

Ms. Tremayne has received two Encouragement Awards from the **Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions**, and has been a two-time winner in both the **La Jolla Symphony and Chorus Young Artist Competition** and the **Virginia and Susan Hawk Memorial Young Artist Competition**. Eden has also won the **Johann Strauss Competition in Vancouver**, the **Musical Merit Foundation of Greater San Diego Competition**, the **UBC Concerto Competition**, the **Vancouver Opera Guild Bursary Award**, **Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques Competition** in Montréal, and the **Women’s Musical Society Bursary Competition** in Vancouver. Eden received both her Bachelor of Music and Master of Music in Opera Performance degrees from the University of British Columbia.

On her off time, Eden has a passion for teaching voice and piano to all ages, and believes strongly in cultivating a love and appreciation for the arts within her community and the world at large.
