This fall Lisette begins in Paris in concert, singing Nannetta in FALSTAFF with the Orchestre de Paris. Afterward, she heads to London where she makes her debut at the Royal Opera House-Covent Garden in the title role of LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR. Then she returns to the Metropolitan Opera to sing her first performances of Gretel in HANSEL AND GRETEL. After the new year, she sings Konstanze in DIE ENTFÜHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL at the Bayerische Staatsoper, a role she has sung there every season since 2014. In the spring she will sing two roles, Eurydice in the French version of Gluck’s ORFEO ED EURIDICE and Gilda in RIGOLETTO, with the Los Angeles Opera. The Teatro Real in Madrid then welcomes Lisette back as LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR.

Last season Lisette was seen as Susanna in LE NOZZE DI FIGARO, and the title role in LA FILLE DU REGIMENT with the Washington National Opera, plus a solo recital there in the spring. She also was invited to sing a private concert in the Chambers of the United States Supreme Court. She then headed to Europe and sang at the Rome Opera as Gilda in RIGOLETTO, in Lausanne as Ophélie in HAMLET, the Dutch National Opera as Gilda in RIGOLETTO, the Bayerische Staatsoper as Konstanze in DIE ENTFÜHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL and debuted as Norina in DON PASQUALE in Glyndebourne.

Lisette has appeared in over 100 performances at the Metropolitan Opera, including Susanna in LE NOZZE DI FIGARO and Gilda in Michael Mayer’s new production of RIGOLETTO, as well as having appeared in 8 of the Met's Live in HD productions. Other career highlights include appearances in the USA and Europe: the title role in LA TRAVIATA with Opera Philadelphia, Gilda at the Teatro Real in Madrid, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, and the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Konstanze at the Opéra National de Paris, Tanglewood Music Festival, Welsh National Opera, and Pittsburgh Opera, the title role of LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR and Fiorilla in IL TURCO IN ITALIA with the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, Cleopatra in GIULIO CESARE with the Michigan Opera Theatre, Susanna in NOZZE at the San Francisco Opera, the Ravinia Festival and the Santa Fe Opera, Nannetta in FALSTAFF at ABAO Opera Bilbao and San Francisco Opera.

Concert highlights include the MOZART C MINOR MASS at the Cincinnati May Festival with Maestro James Conlon, the Mater Gloriosa in MAHLER’S 8TH SYMPHONY with the Philadelphia Orchestra, led by Maestro Yannick Nezet-Séguin. She has sung CARMINA BURANA with the Chicago Symphony, conducted by Maestro Riccardo Muti, with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and the Cleveland Orchestra. In 2008 she sang Brahms’ LIEBESLIEDER-WALZER at Weill Hall with James Levine and Daniel Barenboim at the pianos.
