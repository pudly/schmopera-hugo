Praised for her "clear voice soaring to stratospheric heights" (Opera Canada), soprano Andrea Lett is quickly making a name for herself in the classical music scene across Canada. Ms. Lett made her Manitoba Opera debut in the 2018/19 season as Zerlina in _Don Giovanni_, and returns as Berta in Manitoba Opera’s spring production of _The Barber of Seville_. Ms. Lett made her Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra debut in March as the soprano soloist in Mozart’s _Requiem_, and will join the North York Concert Orchestra in June as the soprano soloist in Beethoven’s 9th Symphony. Upcoming performances include Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra’s _Messiah_ in December 2019, and Regina Symphony Orchestra’s Beethoven’s 9th Symphony in 2020. 

A recipient of the CBC Young Artist’s Development Prize and the Audience Choice Award in the 2018 Canadian Opera Company’s Center Stage Gala, Ms. Lett will record and be featured on CBC’s In Concert program and Saturday Afternoon at the Opera. 

Lett was engaged at San Francisco Opera as a principal cover (Ah Sing) for the world premiere of John Adams and Peter Sellars’s _Girls of the Golden West_. A 2017 Apprentice Artist for Santa Fe Opera, her roles have included Musetta (Saskatoon Mainstage Opera) Adele cover (Santa Fe Opera), Queen of the Night (Manitoba Underground Opera), Gretel (Saskatoon Opera School Tour), and Rose Maybud in _Ruddigore_ (Winnipeg G&S Society).
