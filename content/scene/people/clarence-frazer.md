Canadian/Korean baritone Clarence Frazer brings his "silky-smooth baritone" to a wide range of roles and concert repertoire. An alumnus of Canadian Opera Company's prestigious Ensemble Studio and Calgary Opera's McPhee Artist Development Program, Clarence starred as Figaro in Il barbiere di Siviglia with Pacific Opera Victoria and Saskatoon Opera and sang Marcello in Against the Grain Theatre's acclaimed production of La bohème, touring from the Yukon to Toronto.

This season, Clarence kicks off his season as Papageno in Vancouver Opera's The Magic Flute, followed by his debut with Orchestre classique de Montréal in Piazzolla's "tango opera" María de Buenos Aires, Jacques Lacombe, conducting. Concert performances include Messiah with Symphony Nova Scotia, and Bach's Markus Passion with Metropolitan United Church, Toronto.

Clarence recently debuted with Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Thunder Bay Symphony in performances of Messiah, and was a guest soloist in "God, Thy Earth is Aflame" by Latvian composer Lucija Garuta, with Ottawa Choral Society. Clarence performed with Chorus Niagara in "The Houses Stand Not Far Apart" (Estacio) and Vaughan Williams' Dona Nobis Pacem. 

Clarence recently added Demetrius in A Midsummer Night's Dream and Guglielmo in Cosi fan tutte to his repertoire, with Vancouver Opera and Edmonton Opera.

Clarence is featured in several OperaBreaks cinematic videos directed by François Racine and produced by Domoney Artists during the pandemic.
