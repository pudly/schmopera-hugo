Canadian/Korean baritone Clarence Frazer brings his athletic presence and “silky-smooth baritone” to a wide range of roles. An alumnus of Canadian Opera Company’s prestigious Ensemble Studio and Calgary Opera’s Emerging Artist Development Program, Clarence starred as **Figaro** with Pacific Opera Victoria in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_, **Marcello** with Saskatoon Opera in _La bohéme_, and **Figaro** in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ with Windsor Symphony and with Southern Ontario Lyric Opera.

Clarence begins the 2019/20 season as **Marcello** in Against the Grain Theatre’s updated production of _La bohéme_, touring from Yukon to Toronto, covers the role of **Count Almaviva** with Edmonton Opera’s _Le Nozze di Figaro_, and makes his soloist debut in Brahms’ _Ein Deutsches Requiem_ with Hamilton’s Bach Elgar Choir.

Mr. Frazer has displayed his affinity for contemporary opera, singing the role of **William Cormack** in _Shanawdithit_ (Burry/Nolan), a co-production of Tapestry Opera and Opera on the Avalon, and portrayed **James Isbister** in the Canadian Opera Company’s acclaimed production of _Louis Riel_, with further performances at National Arts Centre and L’Opera de Quebec. Clarence recently joined the cast of _Le Nozze di Figaro_ in concert, understudying **Figaro** and singing **Antonio** with the National Arts Centre Orchestra; Alexander Shelley, conductor.

Recent concert performances for Mr. Frazer include _Messiah_ (Windsor Symphony, Rideau Chorale, Chorus Niagara), and Mozart’s _Requiem_ with Grand Philharmonic Choir, as well as Handel’s _Israel in Egypt_ with Ottawa’s Caelis Academy Ensemble; Matthew Larkin, conductor.
