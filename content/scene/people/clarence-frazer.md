Canadian/Korean baritone Clarence Frazer brings his “silky-smooth baritone” to a wide range of roles and concert repertoire. An alumnus of Canadian Opera Company’s prestigious Ensemble Studio and Calgary Opera’s McPhee Artist Development Program, Clarence starred as **Figaro** in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ with Pacific Opera Victoria and Saskatoon Opera, and sang **Marcello** in Against the Grain Theatre’s acclaimed 2019 production of _La bohéme_, touring from Yukon to Toronto.

This season, Clarence debuts with Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Thunder Bay Symphony in performances of _Messiah_, and is a guest soloist in _"God, Thy Earth is Aflame"_ by Latvian composer Lucija Garuta, with Ottawa Choral Society. Clarence also performs with Chorus Niagara in _“The Houses Stand Not Far Apart”_ (Estacio) and Vaughan Williams’ _Dona Nobis Pacem_.

Recent concert engagements include Brahms’ _Ein Deutsches Requiem_ with Hamilton’s Bach-Elgar Choir, and Mozart’s _Requiem_ with Grand Philharmonic Choir. Clarence also sang **Guglielmo** in Edmonton Opera’s _Cosi fan tutte_, and starred as **Claudio** in _Béatrice et Bénédict_ with Opera Kelowna.

In 2023, Clarence debuts as **Demetrius** with Vancouver Opera in Britten’s _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_.

Clarence is featured in several OperaBreaks cinematic videos directed by François Raçine and produced by Domoney Artists during the pandemic.
