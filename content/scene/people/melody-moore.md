Soprano Melody Moore is enjoying a thriving career on the world’s leading stages, prompting _Opera News_ to label her “a revelation,” and of her recent sold-out appearance at Carnegie Hall to rave, “As I left the auditorium, I could only think: more of Moore, please.” The current season marks the release of her first solo album entitled _An American Song Album_ with pianist Bradley Moore on Pentatone Records.

In the 2019-2020 season, Ms. Moore will make two notable role debuts: her debut as Amneris in a new production of _Aida_ at the Houston Grand Opera, and following, her role and house debut as the Foreign Princess in _Rusalka_ at Cincinnati Opera.

Concert highlights include her debut with the Houston Symphony Orchestra in Mahler’s _Das klagende Lied_ under the baton of Music Director Andrés Orozco-Estrada, the title role in Strauss’ _Salome_ at Bard College, and a solo recital and masterclass at Lawrence University.

On the concert stage, she debuted with the Dresdner Philharmonie in the roles of Giorgetta in Puccini’s _Il Tabarro_ and Santuzza in Mascagni’s _Cavalleria Rusticana_, both of which were recorded for commercial release by Pentatone Records. Ms. Moore also sang Senta with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Music Director Edo de Waart, and debuted with the Grant Park Music Festival for Delius’ _A Mass of Life_ at the Grant Park Music Festival, and sang the title role in Salome in Daegu, South Korea. Other recording projects included Minnie in _La Fanciulla del West_ in Cluj, Romania, and the title role in _Madama Butterfly_ in Lisbon, both recorded for commercial release by Pentatone Records.

In the 2017-2018 season, Moore made three major role debuts: Elisabetta in _Don Carlo_ at Washington National Opera; the title role in _Salome_ at Florida Grand Opera; and Tatyana in _Eugene Onegin_ at Hawaii Opera Theater, as well as singing her signature roles of Tosca in a return to Opéra de Montréal and for her house debut with Teatro Municipal de Santiago de Chile, and Senta in Wagner’s _Der fliegende Holländer_ in a new production by Tomer Zvulun at Atlanta Opera.
