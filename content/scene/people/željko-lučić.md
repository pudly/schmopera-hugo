Serbian baritone, Zeljko Lucic, continues to gain recognition for his performances of the dramatic repertoire in the world’s leading opera houses, including the Metropolitan Opera, Royal Opera House, San Francisco Opera, l’Opéra National de Paris, Teatro alla Scala and the Wiener Staatsoper. For his appearance in _La forza del destino_ with San Francisco Opera, the Financial Times declared, “with this Don Carlo, Zeljko Lucic served notice that he is one of today’s pre-eminent Verdi baritones.”

His many engagements in the 2007-08 season included the Metropolitan Opera, singing the title role in a new production of Verdi’s _Macbeth_ (conducted by James Levine); the Wiener Staatsoper as Germont in _La traviata_; Staatsoper Dresden for the title role in _Rigoletto_; and Oper Frankfurt to reprise the title roles of _Simon Boccanegra_ and _Macbeth_, as Iago in concert performances of _Otello_, and Michele in _Il tabarro_ and the title role of Gianni Schicchi in Puccini’s _Il trittico_.

In subsequent seasons, he sang Iago in a new production of _Otello_ at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, _La Traviata_ at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden and _Forza del Destino_ at the Wiener Staatsoper as well as _Ballo in Maschera_ at Teatro alla Scala and _Macbeth_ conducted by Muti at the Salzburg Festival. He also performed in new productions of _Rigoletto_ at the Metropolitan Opera and _Simone Boccanegra_ at the Bayerische Staatsoper.

During the 2015/16 season, he returned to the Metropolitan Opera (_Otello, Tosca),_ to the Lyric Opera of Chicago (_Nabucco),_ to the Oper Frankfurt _(Gianni Schicchi),_ to the Opéra National de Paris _(La Traviata)_ and to Covent Garden _(Il Trovatore)._ In 2016/17, Zeljko Lucic sang namely _Otello_ in Zurich and at Covent Garden, _Rigoletto_ at the Paris Opera and _Nabucco_ and _Rigoletto_ at the Metropolitan Opera. He also appeared at the Met as a soloist in the Opera’s 50th anniversary Gala.

Zejlko’s 2017/18 season engagements included, amongst others, his return to the Wiener Staatsoper for _Salomé_ and _Macbeth_ and the Bayerische Staatsoper for _Tosca_ and _Simon Boccanegra_, as well as to the Paris Opera (_Il trovatore_) and Covent Garden (_Macbeth)_. He also reprised the title role of _Rigoletto_ at Oper Frankfurt, and appeared again at the Metropolitan Opera in _Cavalleria Rusticana & Pagliacci._

Zeljko Lucic has also appeared with many orchestras, including the Hessischer Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, Belgrade Philharmony, RTB Symphony Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He is a recipient of the 1997 first prize at the International Competition Francisco Viñas in Barcelona. Mr. Lucic has studied extensively with world-renowned mezzo Biserka Cveji

The end of 2018 will see Zeljko return to the Met for _Otello_ and to Frankfurt where he will give concerts of Verdi’s _Il Carsaro_.
