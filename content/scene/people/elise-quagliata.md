Elise Quagliata, mezzo-soprano, has garnered critical notice over the past decade for her “rich, expressive voice and passionate delivery” (*The New York Times*) in a wide range of repertoire, from *Carmen* and *Dead Man Walking* to *Sweeney Todd*, and from oratorio and art song to cabaret.

The artist’s upcoming appearances include Sister Helen in *Dead Man Walking* with the Modern American Music Project, Joan Clarke in American Lyric Theater’s workshop of *The Turing Project*, the Verdi *Requiem* in Brazil with maestro Fabio Mechetti and the Orquestra Filarmônica de Minas Gerais of Belo Horizonte and with the Jacksonville Symphony, Fricka in Union Avenue Opera’s *Die Walküre*, Carmen in *Carmen* with Pensacola Opera, as well as various recitals, masterclasses and cabaret performances in New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania.

Recent acclaim has greeted Ms. Quagliata’s performances in *Eugene Onegin* (Des Moines Metro Opera), where *Opera News* noted her “adorable Olga, who moved with a dancer’s grace, and deftly essayed the requisite low notes.”  A “commanding figure” with “vocal power and concentration” as Fricka in *Das Rheingold* (Union Avenue Opera, St. Louis), the artist was by contrast a “hilarious and beautifully twisted” Mrs. Lovett in *Sweeney Todd* (Pensacola Opera).
