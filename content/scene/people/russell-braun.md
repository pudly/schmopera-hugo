Renowned for his luminous voice “capable of the most powerful explosions as well as the gentlest covered notes” (Toronto Star) baritone Russell Braun rightfully claims his place on the concert, opera and recital stages of the world. His intelligent and thoughtful portrayals of Chou En-lai, Billy Budd, Prince Andrei, Figaro, Papageno, Count Almaviva, Don Giovanni, Pelléas, Eugene Onegin, and The Traveller have captivated audiences. Highlights of the 2021/22 season include Sam _A Quiet Place_ for Opéra national de Paris, Speaker _Die Zauberflöte_ for the Canadian Opera Company and on the concert platform, Britten’s _War Requiem_ with the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich.

Recent operatic highlights include Peter _Hänsel und Gretel_ and Don Alfonso _Così fan tutte_ at the Canadian Opera Company, Peter _Hänsel und Gretel_ with Michigan Opera Theatre, a new collaboration with director Tim Albery on Hanns Eisler’s _Hollywood Songbook_, _Hell’s Fury_, Luminato Festival, Pentheus _The Bassarids_, Salzburg Festival, Alfred Ill _Der Besuch der alten Dame_ at Theater an der Wien, Figaro _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ at Calgary Opera and the title role of the Canadian Opera Company’s new production of _Louis Riel_ in Toronto at the Four Seasons Centre and in Ottawa with the National Arts Centre Orchestra presented as part of the celebrations surrounding Canada’s 150th Anniversary. Previous seasons have included Count Almaviva _Le Nozze di Figaro_, Ford _Falstaff_, Duke of Nottingham _Roberto Devereux_ and Conte di Luna _Il Trovatore_, all with the Canadian Opera Company, Chou En-lai _Nixon in China_, Lescaut _Manon Lescaut_ and as Olivier alongside Renée Fleming in _Capriccio_, all at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

On the concert platform, Braun sings regularly with the world’s major conductors and orchestras, including the Atlanta Symphony, Toronto Symphony, Montreal Symphony, Danish National Symphony and Houston Symphony. A great affinity for contemporary repertoire, he has performed Peter Eötvös’s _Senza Sangue_ in Rome, London, Norway and Sweden, Brett Dean’s _Knocking at the Hell Gate_ with the BBC Symphony in London, and Kaija Saariaho’s _Cinque reflets de l’amour de loin_ with the RadioSinfonieorchester in both Stuttgart and Freiburg. Recent highlights include Brahms’s _Vier Ernste Gesänge_ arranged by Detlev Glanert and Fauré’s _Requiem_ with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Vaughn Williams’s A Sea Symphony with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

His discography features the GRAMMY-nominated _Das Lied von der Erde_ (Dorian), JUNO winners Mozart _Arie e duetti_ (CBC) and _Apollo e Daphne_, and JUNO nominee _Winterreise_ (CBC). His most recent release is Dietch’s _Le Vaisseau Fantôme_ with Les Musiciens du Louvre Grenoble on the Naïve label. DVDs include the Salzburg Festival’s _Romeo et Juliette_ and the Mark Morris dance adaptation of _Dido and Aeneas_, his much-lauded portrayal of Chou En-lai in Adams’s _Nixon in China_ (Nonesuch) and _Capriccio_ (Decca) at the Metropolitan Opera (released on DVD as part of the company’s Live-in-HD series) and Alexina Louie’s comic opera _Burnt Toast_.
