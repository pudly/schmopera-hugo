"Her voice with its pure, incisive and delicate timbre radiates tenderness in the middle register, while she floats her golden high register to the limits of audibility." _– Le Monde_

Praised for her vocal beauty, seamless technique, and abundant musicality, Nadine Sierra is being hailed as one of the most promising, young talents in opera today. She was named the Richard Tucker Award Winner in 2017 and was awarded the 2018 Beverly Sills Artist Award by the Metropolitan Opera. Having made a string of successful debuts at the Met, Teatro alla Scala, Opéra national de Paris, and Staatsoper Berlin, she has become a fixture at many of the top houses around the world. On August 24th, 2018, her debut album, _There’s a Place for Us_, was released under the Deutsche Grammophon-Universal Music labels. Her second solo album, _Made For Opera_, is scheduled for release on March 4th 2022 for Deutsche Grammophon.

In the 2021-22 season, Sierra makes her house debuts with Maggio Musicale Fiorentino for the first time as Violetta (_La traviata_), at Teatro Colón (_L’elisir d’amore_), and at the Bavarian State Opera as Lucia (_Lucia di Lammermoor_), a role she also sings at Teatro di San Carlo and The Metropolitan Opera. Moreover, she appears as Gilda (_Rigoletto_) at Opéra de Paris and Teatro alla Scala. In concert, she performs in Recital with Palm Beach Opera, in Buenos Aires, in Montevideo, and in concert with Berliner Philharmoniker, Turku Music Festival, Opera Liège, Wiener Konzerthaus, Klangvokal Festival Dortmund and at Salle Gaveau.

Ms. Sierra’s most recent seasons included the roles of Lucia at Gran Teatre del Liceu, Musetta (_La bohème_) at Opera Las Palmas, Juliette (_Roméo et Juliette_) at San Francisco Opera, Susanna (_Le nozze di Figaro_) and her signature role of Gilda under the baton of Daniel Barenboim in a new production of _Rigoletto_ at the Staatsoper Berlin, where she also reprised Nannetta and debuted as Sophie (_Der Rosenkavalier_); Susanna and Gilda at the Metropolitan Opera, and her highly anticipated house and role debut as _Manon_ at the Opéra national de Bordeaux, followed by Juliette. Concert appearances included the debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra and newly appointed Metropolitan Opera Music Director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin; Maria (_West Side Story_) with Antonio Pappano at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Teatro La Fenice’s televised Capodanno celebration, the Richard Tucker Gala at Carnegie Hall, and her concert debuts in Prague, Bordeaux, and Baden-Baden. She appeared in recitals at Grand Théâtre de Genève and in Kansas City (Harriman-Jewell Series) and she joined Andrea Bocelli at Madison Square Garden in NYC, TD Garden in Boston, PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Capital One Arena in Washington, and returned to Paris, Dallas, and Mexico City to give solo concerts.

Other notable engagements from past seasons include the title role in _Lucia di Lammermoor_ at Teatro La Fenice, Nannetta at the Staatsoper Berlin, Zerlina (_Don Giovanni_), Flavia (_Eliogabalo_), Pamina (_Die Zauberflöte_), Gilda (_Rigoletto_) and Norina (_Don Pasquale_) at Opéra National de Paris. She has also performed Gilda, Zerlina, Ilia in _Idomeneo_ and Susanna in _Le nozze di Figaro_ at the Metropolitan Opera. At the San Francisco Opera, she has performed Lucia, Musetta, Pamina, and Contessa and in 2016, she and Leo Nucci made headlines after her house debut in _Rigoletto_ at Teatro alla Scala when, on opening night, they were prompted by the audience to encore the duet, breaking a La Scala tradition dating back to Toscanini. Among many of her concert appearances ranging from Carnegie Hall, Arena di Verona, Musikverein in Vienna, Tanglewood and Ravinia music festivals, Dallas Opera, Park Avenue Armory in NYCm, the soprano also had the privilege and honor of performing twice at the U.S. Supreme Court for the Honorable Justices.

Throughout Ms. Sierra’s young career, she has taken home several awards and is the youngest winner to date for both the Marilyn Horne Foundation Vocal Competition and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, as recounted by Nick Romeo in his book _Driven: Six Incredible Musical Journeys_ (2011), a chapter of which is devoted to Sierra’s Grand Finals triumph. She also took home first prizes in 2010 at the George London Competition, Gerda Lissner International Competition, and Loren Zachary Competition, and was a recipient of a Richard Tucker Music Foundation Study Grant. In 2013, she placed first at the Neue Stimmen, Caballé, and Veronica Dunne International Singing Competitions, and won a Richard Tucker Music Foundation Career Grant.

Ms. Sierra fell in love with opera at a young age, after watching a VHS of _La bohème_, and began voice lessons at the age of six in her home state of Florida. Although she made her professional debut as a teenager with the Palm Beach Opera, she decided to continue studying, and received her bachelor’s degree from Mannes College the New School for Music. Following graduation, she went on to participate in the Adler Fellowship Program at the San Francisco Opera, forming a lasting relationship with the company.

She has been featured in _Vogue_, _Nylon_, _Bon Appetite_, _Opera News_, on the cover of _Classical Singer_ magazine, and numerous international TV and print media. She maintains an active presence on social media, where she interacts with her followers by answering messages, comments and questions on a daily basis. On her Instagram profile, she has launched two successful series, _Mornings with Nadine_ and _Notes from Nadine_, giving her followers an exclusive look at the life of a modern-day opera singer.
