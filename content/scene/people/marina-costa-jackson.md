Italian-American soprano **Marina Costa-Jackson** is "dramatically and musically alluring…notable for her burnished timbre and subtle phrasing (_The New York Times_). In 2022-2023 the Utah Valley University School of Arts features Marina as Mimì (_La bohème_). Lyric Opera of Kansas City sees her debut in the title role of _Tosca_; San Diego Opera as Suor Angelica (_Suor Angelica_) and Lauretta (_Gianni Schicchi_). The pandemic-delayed role of Giulietta (_Les contes d'Hoffmann_) with Royal Opera will return in 2024.
