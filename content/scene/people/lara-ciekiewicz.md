Hailed for her “tour-de-force performance” (Winnipeg Free Press) in the title role of Manitoba Opera’s _Susannah_, Lara has established herself as a dynamic, intelligent, and moving singing-actress.  Her facility for fully transforming into a character, regardless of genre, has earned her the reputation of being an artistic chameleon. 

This season sees Lara rejoin Opera on the Avalon for their world première of Kaminsky and Moore’s February in the role of Bartender. She subsequently makes role and house debuts as Mother Abbess in _The Sound of Music_ for both the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre and The Citadel Theatre. Lara also returns to her Manitoba Opera family as Micaëla in _Carmen_.

Recent appearances include covering Fiordiligi in _Così fan tutte_ at Pacific Opera Victoria, soloing with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra for Brahms’ _Requiem_ and Dvořák’s _Te Deum_, Manitoba Opera’s 50th Anniversary Gala, Countess in Fargo-Moorhead Opera’s _Le nozze di Figaro_, Beatrice in the Canadian première of Heggie’s _Three Decembers_ as well as a solo recital for the Little Opera Company, Musetta in Edmonton Opera’s _La bohème_, a New Year’s Gala with the Victoria Symphony, Elle in Manitoba Opera’s _La voix humaine_, and Open Air: A Summer Festival of Music for Pacific Opera Victoria and the Victoria Symphony.

Select additional credits (and collaborators) include: Jenůfa/_Jenůfa,_ Amelia/_Simon Boccanegra_ (Pacific Opera Victoria); Tatyana/_Eugene Onegin_ (Calgary Opera); Countess/_Le nozze di Figaro_ (Manitoba Opera, Vancouver Opera); Rosalinde/_Die Fledermaus,_ Sylva/_The Gypsy Princess_ (Toronto Operetta Theatre); Micaëla/_Carmen_ (Fargo-Moorhead Opera, Opera Kelowna, Opera Lyra Ottawa); Musetta/_La Bohème_ (Manitoba Opera, Opéra de Montréal); Beethoven _Symphony No. 9_ (Boise Philharmonic, Oklahoma City Philharmonic, Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra); May/_Ours,_ Cinderella/_Into the Woods,_ Maria/_The Sound of Music_ (Opera on the Avalon).

Lara is increasingly in demand as an adjudicator, and teacher. She holds a Masters in Music (Opera) from McGill University, and a Bachelor of Arts - Honours (Voice) from the University of Winnipeg. She is an alumna of l’Atelier lyrique de l’Opéra de Montréal, San Francisco Opera’s Merola Opera Program, the Janiec Opera Company at the Brevard Music Center, the Banff Centre, Opera NUOVA, and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School (Ballet, Tap, Jazz, Musical Theatre). Lara also enjoys gardening, is an avid walker, loves fabulous footwear, and is a self-professed prairie-girl forever.
