Hailed for her “tour-de-force performance” (_Winnipeg Free Press_) in the title role of Manitoba Opera’s _Susannah_, Lara has established herself as a dynamic, intelligent, and moving singing-actress. Her facility for fully transforming into a character, regardless of genre, has earned her the reputation of being an artistic chameleon.

In addition to the title role in Manitoba Opera’s _Susannah,_ the 2019-20 season saw Lara as Lauretta (_Gianni Schicchi_) and Suor Genovieffa (_Suor Angelica_) for Pacific Opera Victoria’s _Il Trittico_, as a soloist for the Victoria Symphony’s _Messiah,_ and make her Edmonton Opera debut as the Countess (_Le nozze di Figaro_).

Recent appearances include _Open Air: A Summer Festival of Music_ for Pacific Opera Victoria and the Victoria Symphony; _The Sopranos of Winnipeg_ for Manitoba Opera and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra; _Concert in the Cathedral Ruins, Opera in the Garden_, and a film version of the _Easter Hymn_ for Manitoba Opera; _All Those Arias_ for the Little Opera Company; and performing for the Mysterious Barricades Concert Society.

As theatres reopen, upcoming projects include Elle (_La voix humaine_) for Manitoba Opera, and Musetta (_La Bohème_) for Edmonton Opera.

Select additional credits (and collaborators) include: Jenůfa/_Jenůfa,_ Amelia/_Simon Boccanegra_ (Pacific Opera Victoria); Tatyana/_Eugene Onegin_ (Calgary Opera); Countess/_Le nozze di Figaro_ (Manitoba Opera, Vancouver Opera); Rosalinde/_Die Fledermaus,_ Sylva/_The Gypsy Princess_ (Toronto Operetta Theatre); Micaëla/_Carmen_ (Fargo-Moorhead Opera, Opera Kelowna, Opera Lyra Ottawa); Musetta/_La Bohème_ (Manitoba Opera, Opéra de Montréal); Beethoven _Symphony No. 9_ (Boise Philharmonic, Oklahoma City Philharmonic, Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra); May/_Ours,_ Cinderella/_Into the Woods,_ Maria/_The Sound of Music_ (Opera on the Avalon).

Lara is increasingly in demand as an adjudicator, and teacher. She holds a Masters in Music (Opera) from McGill University, and a Bachelor of Arts - Honours (Voice) from the University of Winnipeg. She is an alumna of l’Atelier lyrique de l’Opéra de Montréal, San Francisco Opera’s Merola Opera Program, the Janiec Opera Company at the Brevard Music Center, the Banff Centre, Opera NUOVA, and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School (Ballet, Tap, Jazz, Musical Theatre). Lara also enjoys gardening, is an avid walker, loves fabulous footwear, and is a self-professed prairie-girl forever.
