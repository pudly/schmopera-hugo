Scott Belluz has established himself as engaging vocal artist and versatile singing actor. Praised for his 'warm, rich voice' (_La Marseillaise_) and 'bravura vocal performances' (Now Magazine) Scott brings his sensitive and committed artistry to repertoire ranging from 17th century to newly composed works.

Scott has received great acclaim for his performances in the world premieres of numerous operatic works including: the role of Jimmy Gin in Du Yun/Raven Chacon's _Sweetland_ with The Industry, the title role in Omar Daniel’s _The Shadow_ with Tapestry New Opera, L’Oiseau in Gilles Tremblay’s Opéra _Féerie_ with Chants Libres, Damien in R. Murray Schafer’s _The Children’s Crusade_ with Soundstreams Canada, as well as Opera Briefs and Opera To Go with Tapestry New Opera.

Recent operatic performances have also included _Orlando/Lunaire_ with Opera Erratica, L’humana fragilita and Pisandro in Monteverdi’s _Il ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria_ with Chicago Opera Theatre, Athamas in Handel’s _Semele_ with Pacific Opera Victoria, Oberon in Britten’s _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ at the Banff Centre for the Arts and Medoro in Handel’s _Orlando_, in a French touring production.

On the concert stage, Scott performed in 'Salsa Baroque: Music of Latin America and Spain of the 17th and 18th Century' with Ensemble Caprice, a program which has also been released on CD by the _Analekta_ label. Other recent concert performances include: Handel’s _Messiah_ with the Thunder Bay Symphony, Handel’s _Tamerlano_ with Opera in Concert, Bach’s _Magnificat_ with the Ottawa Choral Society, Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater in Aix en Provence, and recitals in Marseille, Avignon, Toulon, and St. Remy de Provence.

Scott Belluz displayed his versatility in 'The Dublin Messiah' with Aradia Ensemble and in the 2012 world premiere of 'From the House of Mirth' (Sharman/Alex Poch-Goldin), choreographed by James Kudelka, for ColemanLemieux Compagnie. Scott starred in 'A Synonym for Love', the sexy update of a Handel Cantata with Toronto's Volcano Theatre.

In 2015, Scott made his debut with Kitchener - Waterloo Symphony in Mendelssohn's _Midsummer Night's Dream_ and stepped in at very short notice, winning raves in PDQ Bach's hilarious cantata _Iphigenia in Brooklyn_.

Further concert performances include Bach's _St. John Passion_ with Grand River Chorus and  Bach's Cantata No. 147 with Kingston Chamber Choir and Thomas Ades' 'Gefriolsae Mae' with the distinguished Jacaranda Music Series.
