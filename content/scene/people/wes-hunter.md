Praised for his "drama, heart, and shining tone," tenor Wes Hunter is emerging as a charismatic interpreter of both standard repertoire and new works. A native Floridian, Hunter now resides in Boston where he performs a variety of styles ranging from Baroque opera to new concert works. Hunter debuted his solo cabaret to a sold-out audience at Club Café in Boston, featuring various selections from musical theatre composers.

Recent highlights include the title character in Rossini's _Le Comte Ory_ with Lowell House Opera, Oronte in Handel's _Alcina_ with Opera del West, Gastone in Verdi's _La Traviata_ with Southern Vermont Lyric Theatre, the workshop of Julian Wachner's _Rev 23_ with Beth Morrison Projects, and Laurie in Adamo's _Little Women_ with MassOpera. Hunter also premiered the role of Eugene in the _The Body Politic_ by New York composer Leo Hurley with Juventas New Music Ensemble.

Other credits include covering Gastone in _La Traviata_ with Sarasota Opera, Count Almaviva (cover) in Rossini's _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ with Boston Midsummer Opera, Goro (cover) in _Madama Butterfly_ with Martina Arroyo's _Prelude to Performance_, Lindoro in Rossini’s _L’Italiana in Algeri_ as well as Tom Rakewell (cover) in Stravinsky's _The Rake's Progress_ with The Boston Conservatory, and Monostatos in Mozart's _Die Zauberflöte_ with Raylynmor Opera.

A versatile artist, Hunter was featured in a concert with renowned countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, performing pieces by composer Nico Muhly, produced by Beth Morrison Projects. He made his New England debut as a concert soloist joining the Newburyport Choral Society in performances of Mozart’s Mass in C minor and Vaughan Williams' _Serenade to Music_. Other concert repertoire performed includes Handel's _Messiah_ with Belmont Open Sings, Mozart's _Requiem_ with the Paul Madore Chorale, Britten's Rejoice in the Lamb, and Schubert's Mass in G in Washington, D.C. His engagements have taken him around the greater DC Metropolitan area to Christ Lutheran Church, St. Luke's Church, St. Ambrose Catholic Church, and the Takoma Park Seventh-Day Adventist Church.

Hunter received his M.M. in Opera Performance from The Boston Conservatory in May 2015. In 2013 he graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Vocal Performance and a minor in Germanic Studies. While attending the University of Maryland he made his operatic stage debut as Monostatos in _Die Zauberflöte_ with Hub Opera Ensemble.
