Taylor Stayton's "laser-bright timbre" and "exceptional fluidity above the staff" (Opera News) continue to distinguish him as one of the most sought-after tenors in his repertoire. To begin the 2017-2018 season, Stayton made his debut at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in the role of Belfiore in Rossini's *Viaggio a Reims*. Of his contribution to the production, Opera Travel hailed his "extremely impressive performance," and his signature "superb control in shading at the very top." Later this season, he will return to the Metropolitan Opera in the fall, debuting in the role of Camille de Rosillon in Susan Stroman's production of *The Merry Widow*, conducted by War Stare. This season will also see Stayton bring his acclaimed interpretation of Count Almaviva in Rossini's *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* to yet two more company debuts with the Arizona Opera, and the Washington National Opera. With one more company debut awaiting him in the 2017-2018, Stayton will reprise the role of Fenton in Verdi's *Falstaff* in his first performances with Opera Omaha. Stayton then returns to the Des Moines Metro Opera to close out the season in debut performances of Alfred in Strauss' *Die Fledermaus*.

This previous 2016-2017 season was ended with performances of Count Almaviva with the Florentine Opera in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia*. Described as "deserving to be numbered on the short list of Rossini all-stars" by Opera Today, Stayton with Opéra de Lille in 2012 and has since reprised the role at many of the world's most presitious opera houses to great reception. Stayton's Almaviva has been seen at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Opera Dijon, Staatsoper Dresden, The Norwegian National Opera, Opera Philadelphia, the Glyndenbourne Festival, and more. Additional roles in the bel canto repertoire include Lord Arturo Bucklaw in his debut with the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Katie Mitchell's production of *Lucia di Lammermoor*, as the title character in *Le comte Ory* with Des Moines Metro Opera, Don Ramiro in *La Cenerentola* at the Norwegian National Opera, Tonio in *La fille du Regiment* in his debut with the Palm Beach Opera, and his house and role debuts singing Lindoro in *L'Italiana in Algeri* with Lyric Opera of Kansas City. Stayton made his critically acclaimed Metropolitan Opera debut in a last-minute performance as Percy in *Anna Bolena*, for which his effort warranted a quick return as Elvino in *La Sonnambula* opposite Diana Damrau. 

Other recent debuts include with the Bayerische Staatsoper as Marzio in *Mitridate, re di Ponto*; Kentucky Opera as Don Ottavio in *Don Giovanni*; Ernesto in *Don Pasquale* with Des Moines Metro Opera; Tybalt in *Roméo et Juliette* with Opera Philadelphia; Don Alvar in *L'Africaine* with Opera Orchestra of New York; and Teatro dell-Opera di Roma as Fenton in the new Franco Zeffirelli production of *Falstaff* with Renato Bruson and Carlos Alvarez.

A native of Sidney, Ohio, Stayton is a 2011 graduate of The Academy of Vocal Arts as a student of the renowned voice teacher Bill Schuman. He earned his Bachelor of Music degree at Ohio State University, and is an alumnus of the Martina Arroyo Foundation's "Prelude to Performance" program.
