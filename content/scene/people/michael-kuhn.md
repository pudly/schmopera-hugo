Described as “an artist of almost terrifying magnetism” (_New York Observer_), “polished, soignee and hot to trot” (The Houston Press), and praised for his "clear and robust" tenor (_Opera News_), Michael Kuhn is a versatile singing-actor equally at home in the fields of opera, musical theatre and concert repertoire.

Michael recently made his debut at Carnegie Hall as the tenor soloist in Haydn’s _Mariazellermesse_ with MidAmerica Productions. In New York City, He has performed in two Off-Broadway runs of Vid Guerrerio’s _¡Figaro! 90210_ as Basel, and was most recently seen as Romano in the world premiere of Stonewall by Iain Bell and Mark Campbell, produced by New York City Opera in conjunction with the 50 year anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. Michael has performed throughout the US at companies such as Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Florida Grand Opera, Central City Opera, Virginia Opera, Syracuse Opera, The Caramoor Festival, The Princeton Festival, Opera in the Heights, Livermore Valley Opera and more. In the summer of 2018 he made his international debut with France’s Festival Lyrique-en-Mer as Spoletta in Tosca and as the tenor soloist in Haydn’s _Lord Nelson Mass_, and returns in 2019 as Normanno in _Lucia di Lammermoor_. Later this season, he portrays Martin in the upcoming staged workshop of STAY by John Glover and Kelley Rourke with On Site Opera on New York City’s Governor’s Island, and makes his debut with Opera Omaha as Pedrillo in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_.

In the concert realm, Michael was heard both nationally via broadcast and in Jordan Hall in the world premiere of _Illuminessence, Prayers for Peace_, a Vatican-commissioned oratorio performed as part of The New England Conservatory’s ten-year memorial concert for September 11th. He has performed as a soloist with the Omaha Symphony, MidAmerica Productions at Carnegie Hall, The Carolina Philharmonic, Cape Symphony, Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, Symphony by the Sea, Bourbon Baroque, The New York Choral Society and the Grace Chorale of Brooklyn in works such as Handel’s _Messiah_, Mozart’s _Requiem_, Bach’s _Christmas Oratorio_, Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_ and Britten’s _Rejoice in the Lamb_.

A passionate recitalist, Michael recently debuted a self-directed and produced project in collaboration with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) titled _Nacht und Träume_, a staged recital of German lieder programmed to represent a journey through a night of vivid dreaming, performed on a bed and surrounded by artwork curated as part of an exhibit called _The Lure of the Dark_.

Michael is a native of Crofton, MD and currently resides in New York City. He is an alumnus of the New England Conservatory (MM Vocal Performance) and Syracuse University (BM Music Industry).
