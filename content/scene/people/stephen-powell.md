The dynamic American baritone Stephen Powell brings his “rich, lyric baritone, commanding presence, and thoughtful musicianship” to a wide range of music (Wall Street Journal). He recently made a successful debut performance as the title role in Macbeth with Michigan Opera Theatre, of which Opera News wrote “Powell’s undeniably powerful voice seethed with potential until his astonishing Act IV andante, when the gleaming beauty and sumptuous musicality of his rich baritone was finally given resplendent display."

In the 2016-17 season, Mr. Powell made his Seattle Opera debut as Germont in La traviata, as well as with the San Diego Opera, for which Opera Today wrote, “Powell’s large, resonant voice enchanted the San Diego operagoers, and they greeted his aria ‘Di Provenza il mar, il suol’ with momentous applause." He also sang Oliver Jordan in the world premiere of William Bolcom’s Dinner at Eight with Minnesota Opera and made his role debut as Prus in The Makropulos Case with San Francisco Opera. As concert soloist, Mr. Powell joined Kansas City Symphony and North Carolina Symphony in Britten’s War Requiem, and Philadelphia Orchestra in Carmina Burana.
