Jorell Williams has been hailed by Opera News as having “a solid vocal core and easy, natural production” and the New York Times for being “magnificent” and “rich toned”.

An American operatic baritone with a wide variety of experience from standard repertoire to premiere pieces, Jorell begins the 2022-23 season debuting as **Escamillo** in Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Bizet’s _Carmen_, followed by _Carmina Burana_ with Toronto’s Amadeus Choir, Händel’s _Messiah_ with the Elmer Iseler Singers and also with National Philharmonic Orchestra in Maryland. Jorell is a soloist in Michael Tippett’s _A Child of Our Time_ with the Duluth Superior Symphony, appears in concert with Finger Lakes Opera and LyricFest Philadelphia.

In 2023, Jorell debuts with Tapestry Opera in the world premiere of Métis composer Ian Cusson’s _Of The Sea_.

Last season, Jorell opened in the world premiere of Paul Frucht’s _A More Perfect Union_ (based on speeches of President Barack Obama) with the Ridgefield Symphony Orchestra, sang **Belcore** in _L’elisir d’amore_ with Dayton Opera, and Händel’s _Messiah_ with the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra, followed by the world premiere of Ricky Ian Gordon and Lynn Nottage’s _Intimate Apparel_ in a co-production of The Metropolitan Opera and Lincoln Center Theater (filmed for PBS Great Performances).

Jorell was also featured in concert with the Caramoor International Music Festival, and in performances with Seattle Opera, Fort Worth Opera, Finger Lakes Opera, New York Festival of Song (NYFOS), and Brooklyn Art Song Society.

As a multifaceted musician, Mr. Williams has also recorded world premieres with Wynton Marsalis, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, David Lang, Jennifer Higdon, and Damien Sneed.

Jorell holds degrees from the Manhattan School of Music and SUNY Purchase Conservatory of Music. He is an advocate for artist rights and a recently appointed artistic council advisor for On-Site Opera and the board for the Brooklyn Art Song Society, using his experience to consult with arts organizations on their Equity, Diversity and Inclusion initiatives.
