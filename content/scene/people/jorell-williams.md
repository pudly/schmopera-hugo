American Baritone Jorell Williams, known for having "a solid vocal core and easy, natural production" (_Opera News_), and "a deliciously resonant baritone voice" (_Broadway World_) has been heralded as "a rock-solid singer with a keen understanding of his own expressive depths" (_The Washington Post_), is gracing the world's most prominent concert and opera stages.

The 2023-2024 season showcases Mr. Williams in debut engagements with Opera Omaha, Greek National Opera, Catapult Opera, Symphony Nova Scotia, The Ottawa Choral Society, and The Canadian Art Song Project, with returns to the National Philharmonic Orchestra, Brooklyn Art Song Society, and Tapestry Opera. A Native of Brentwood, NY, Jorell made his Lincoln Center Theater Off-Broadway debut in Lynn Nottage and Ricky Ian Gordon's critically acclaimed _Intimate Apparel_ in January 2022 (co-production with The Metropolitan Opera / filmed for _PBS Great Performances_). 

His career has brought him on tour with the Mark Morris Dance Company, Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Chorale Le Chateau, American Modern Ensemble, and Essential Voices USA. He had the honor to perform with Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in _A Celebration of America_ at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater on the occasion of the first Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama, as well as the European premiere of Marsalis' _Abyssinian Mass_ at the Barbican during the 2012 Olympics in London. Mr. Williams has also worked alongside some of today's most versatile artists, including Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Damien Sneed, Jon Batiste, David Lang, and most recently, Jennifer Higdon for her 2017 Grammy nominated World Premiere Opera _Cold Mountain_ with the Santa Fe Opera.

Jorell has won awards from organizations such as The Jensen Foundation, The Gerda Lissner International Competition, The Schuyler Foundation for Career Bridges, The Licia Albanese Puccini Foundation, The American Traditions Competition, Harlem Opera Theater Competition, The National Association of Negro Musicians [NAMN], The Liberace Foundation, The Serge & Olga Koussevitzky Competition, Civic Morning Musicals Competition, David Adams Art Song Competition, and the Rochester Classical Idol XII Prize. 

He is an advocate for artist rights and serves as chair of the artistic arts council of Finger Lakes Opera, is a member of the artistic council advisor for The Denyce Graves Foundation, On-Site Opera, and currently on the New Music Board for the Brooklyn Art Song Society, using his experience to consult with arts organizations on their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives.
