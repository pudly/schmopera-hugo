Motivated and hungry for new experiences, Ms. Brueggergosman’s career effortlessly embraces the broadest array of performance platforms and musical styles and genres.

On the opera stage, her recent highlights include Giulietta and Antonia *Les contes d’Hoffmann*, Elettra *Idomeneo*, Madame Lidoine *Dialogues des Carmélites*, Jenny in Weill’s *Mahagonny*, Emilia Marty *Věc Makropulos*, Hannah in Miroslav Srnka’s *Make No Noise*, and Sister Rose in Jake Heggie’s *Dead Man Walking* while on the concert platform she has worked with the San Francisco Symphony and New World Symphony Orchestras and conductors such as Daniel Barenboim, Michael Tilson Thomas, Franz WelserMöst, Sir Andrew Davis, Gustavo Dudamel and Daniel Harding.

Measha began her career predominantly committed to the art of the song recital and has presented innovative programs at Carnegie Hall, Washington’s Kennedy Center, London’s Wigmore Hall, both the Konzerthaus and Musikverein in Vienna, Madrid’s Teatro Real, as well as at the Schwarzenberg, Edinburgh, Verbier and Bergen Festivals with celebrated collaborative pianists Justus Zeyen, Roger Vignoles, Julius Drake, and Simon Lepper.

Her forthcoming highlights include her Australian debut at the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and in recital at the Sydney Opera House, a return to the Teatro Real, Madrid and to the Barbican, London with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, as well as performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic with Vasily Petrenko and the Los Angeles Philharmonic with Sir Michael Tilson Thomas.

Her first recording for Deutsche Grammophon, Surprise, includes works by Schoenberg, Satie and Bolcom and is one of the most highly regarded debut albums of recent years. Her subsequent disc Night and Dreams, which features songs by Mozart, Brahms, Strauss, Schubert, Debussy, Duparc and Fauré won several awards and her recording of the Wesendonck Lieder with Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra earned her a Grammy nomination.

Off the stage, Measha is just as active: she has just released her memoir “There is Always Something on Fire” published by Harper Collins, she appears regularly on primetime TV (most recently advocating on behalf of contemporary Canadian literature); and leading Canadian children across the country in song, in celebration of the nationwide campaign for music education.

Measha Brueggergosman champions the education and involvement of new audiences and holds several honorary doctorates and ambassadorial titles with international charities.
