Bass-baritone Dashon Burton has established a vibrant career appearing regularly throughout the US and Europe in favorite pieces, including Bach’s _St. John_ and _St. Matthew Passions_ and the _Mass in B Minor_, Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_, Beethoven’s Symphony no. 9, Brahms’ _Ein Deutsches Requiem_, Handel’s _Messiah_, and Mozart’s _Requiem_.  
  
He opened the 2021–22 season with the Handel & Haydn Society of Boston led by Marin Alsop for Beethoven’s Symphony no. 9 which he will repeat later this season with the Nashville Symphony and Giancarlo Guerrero. Throughout the season he makes several notable orchestral debuts, including with the Chicago Symphony in Handel’s _Messiah_ led by Nicholas McGegan, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic with Michael Tilson Thomas for the maestro’s new song cycle _Meditations on Rilke_, with the Pittsburgh Symphony performing Dvořák’s _Te Deum_ as led by Manfred Honeck, and Verdi’s _Requiem_ with the Seattle Symphony and Thomas Dausgaard.  
  
He continues his relationship with San Francisco Performances as an Artist-in-Residence with appearances at venues and educational institutions throughout the Bay Area and makes a debut with Celebrity Series of Boston in recital.  
  
Operatic engagements in recent seasons have included Strauss’ _Salome_ at the Salzburg Festival led by Franz Welser-Möst, Peter Sellars’ production of Claude Vivier’s _Kopernikus_ throughout France and Germany, Sarastro in Mozart’s _Die Zauberflöte_, and Jupiter in Rameau’s _Castor et Pollux_ with Les Talens Lyriques.  
  
A multiple award winning singer, Mr. Burton won his second Grammy Award in March 2021 for Best Classical Solo Vocal Album with his performance featured in Dame Ethyl Smyth’s masterwork _The Prison_ with The Experiential Orchestra (Chandos). He also received top prizes in the ARD International Music Competition, the Oratorio Society of New York's Vocal Competition, and Bach Bethlehem Vocal Competition.   
  
As an original member of the groundbreaking vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth, he won his first Grammy Award for their inaugural recording of all new commissions, including Caroline Shaw’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Partita for 8 Voices.

His album of spirituals garnered high praise and was singled out by the New York Times as “profoundly moving...a beautiful and lovable disc.”
