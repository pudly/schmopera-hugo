Mezzo-soprano Pascale Spinney, from Montreal QC, is completing her first year as a young artist at the Atelier Lyrique of the Opéra de Montréal.  She obtained her Master’s degree from the Schulich School of Music of McGill University. Several roles at McGill stand out, such as Miles in Britten’s *The Turn of the Screw*, Third Lady in *Die Zauberflöte*, Epicene in the Canadian premiere of John Musto and Mark Campbell’s *Volpone*, Eustazio in *Rinaldo*; a role for which Le Devoir described her as a “...voice of great presence…”, and culminating in the title role in *Giulio Cesare in Egitto*. 

Outside of academia, she sang overseas as Cherubino in *Le nozze di Figaro* in a CO-SI production, Hänsel in a concert version of *Hänsel und Gretel* in Vancouver and at Opera Nuova as Zerlina in *Don Giovanni*. Since graduating in 2013, Pascale has been hired by Opera McGill to cover the role of Hippolyta (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*), to sing the role of Véronique in a Stu&Jess Production of Bizet’s *Le Docteur Miracle*, and to coach Italian diction for the Halifax Summer Opera Festival’s production of *Giulio Cesare in Egitto*. Recently, she has received an encouragement award from the National Council Auditions of the Metropolitan Opera.
