British baritone George von Bergen’s charismatic stage presence and powerful, mellifluous lyric baritone have earned him renown in Europe over the last three years. His numerous successes in recent seasons have had him hailed at English National Opera as “an ideal Sharpless” (*Express*), a “mercurial” Marcello (*Opera Britannia*), and “electrifying” as Zurga (Mark Ronan), whilst his role debut as Enrico *Lucia di Lammermoor* at Danish National Opera was widely acclaimed. Other recent highlights include the title role of Ambroise Thomas’ *Hamlet* in a new production at Croatian National Theatre conducted by Hervé Niquet; Ford *Falstaff* and Belcore *L’elisir d’amore* at Opera Holland Park; and his debut at La Scala, Milan, as Ned Keene in Richard Jones’ acclaimed new production of *Peter Grimes*, which was subsequently released commercially on DVD.

Additional roles include Herald/Lord Hate-good *The Pilgrim’s Progress* and Schaunard *La bohème* (English National Opera); Count Almaviva *Le nozze di Figaro*, Marcello *La bohème* and Ostasio *Francesca da Rimini* (Opera Holland Park); Demetrius *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* for both Garsington and Longborough; the title role of *Don Giovanni*; Marcello *La bohème* at the Torre del Lago Puccini Festival; and Beaumarchais *Ghosts of Versaille* in the award-winning European première at Wexford Opera.

Highlights of the current season include the title role of *Don Giovanni* for English Touring Opera and Sharpless *Madama Butterfly* for ENO.
