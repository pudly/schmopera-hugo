Coloratura soprano Sharleen Joynt has been praised for her "silvery, sparkling, substantial and resonant soprano" \[_Die Deutsche Bühne_\], her "scintillating high range, reminiscent of the most beautiful moments of Mady Mesplé" \[_Opernwelt_\], and "an artistic command that leaves the listener breathless" \[_Deutschland Radio_\].

Recently, Sharleen reprised the role of the Controller in Jonathan Dove’s **_Flight_** for Seattle Opera, which was filmed and released for streaming in April of 2021, critics exclaiming, “We know we’re in for an acting treat when we see Sharleen Joynt’s overpoweringly supercilious, impeccably turned out Controller, prowling her control tower and pulling the strings; we see her arched eyebrows and penetrating stare in close-up as she delivers stratospheric coloratura.” _(Bachtrack)_. She returns to Seattle Opera in 2022 as Amore in Gluck’s **_Orfeo_** and will make her Florida Grand Opera and Opera Colorado debuts as Gilda in **_Rigoletto_.**

2020 was meant to include a reprisal of her signature role of Zerbinetta in **_Ariadne auf Naxos_** with Calgary Opera. Previously, she made a role and company debut as Gilda in **_Rigoletto_** with Edmonton Opera, performed in New Year’s Galas with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, and sang the Controller in Jonathan Dove’s **_Flight_** with Pacific Opera Victoria.

In previous seasons, Sharleen made her Opera Philadelphia debut as Winnie in **_Sky on Swings _**(Beecher), a new opera about Alzheimers starring Frederica von Stade. She made her Vancouver Opera debut as Musetta in **_La Bohème_**. On the concert stage, she also debuted with the Guelph Symphony, singing Glière’s **_Concerto for Coloratura, Op. 82_**_,_ as well as the Charleston Symphony, singing the Soprano Solo in Handel’s **_Messiah_**.

Other highlights include debuting with the Ravinia Music Festival, the Tanglewood Music Festival, the Orlando Philharmonic, and Anchorage Opera as Cunegonde in **_Candide_**, debuting with the Bach Society of St. Louis as the soprano solo in Howard Goodall's requiem, **_Eternal Light_**, debuting **_Symphony No. 4 _**with the Thunder Bay Symphony, and performing both Queen of the Night in **_The Magic Flute _**and Musetta in **_La Bohème_** with Pacific Opera Victoria.

Previously, Sharleen starred as Christine in the Canadian Stage and Soundstreams co-production and North American Premiere of Belgian composer Philippe Boesman’s **_Julie_**, based on the 1888 Strindberg play, “Miss Julie”, and had her Chinese debut as Zerbinetta in Oper Leipzig's production—and the Chinese premiere—of **_Ariadne auf Naxos_**_._

Early career highlights included joining the Metropolitan Opera roster to cover both Fiakermilli and Zerbinetta in R. Strauss' **_Arabella _**and **_Ariadne auf Naxos_**, respectively. Sharleen appeared with the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe (Marie, **_La Fille du Régiment_**_;_ Adele, **_Die Fledermaus_**), Theater und Orchester Heidelberg (Oscar, **_Un Ballo in Maschera_**_;_ Blonde, **_Die Entführung aus dem Serail_**_;_ Soprano 1/Ariadne in Wolfgang Rihm's **_Dionysos_**), Anhaltisches Theater Dessau (Adele, **_Die Fledermaus_**; Oscar, **_Un Ballo in Maschera_**; Despina, **_Cosi Fan Tutte_**), and made her Swiss debut with the Theater St. Gallen (Zerbinetta, **_Ariadne auf Naxos_**).

Sharleen has been nominated for both the prestigious [“Der Faust” prize, awarded by the German Stage Association](http://www.buehnenverein.de/de/netzwerke-und-projekte/der-faust/der-faust-2013.html) (for Wolfgang Rihm's **_Dionysos_**) as well as Nachwunschsängerin (Young Singer of the Year) by [Opernwelt magazine](http://www.opernwelt.de/) (for _Zerbinetta_ in **Ariadne auf Naxos**). Her uncommonly honest embodiment of characters and fearless onstage presence in German Regietheater led to a [3-page article in the May 2013 issue of Deutsche Bühne magazine](http://www.sharleenjoynt.com/s/Joynt_Deutsche_Buehne_magazine.pdf). Sharleen has been a prizewinner in the Liederkranz Foundation, George London Foundation, Young Concert Artists, Licia-Albanese Foundation, Canadian Music Competition's International Stepping Stone, and Palm Beach Opera Vocal Competitions.
