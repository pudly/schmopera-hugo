Praised for her "lively personality, abundant charm, and luscious vocalism" and "crystalline voice," soprano Erica Schuller is a versatile performer, recognized for bringing committed artistry to a broad musical repertory. Her particular affinity for Baroque repertoire has brought her increasing attention from some of the country's finest Early Music ensembles.

​This past season, Ms. Schuller reprised her role as Livietta in Pergolesi's_Livietta e Tracollo_ with the Boston Early Music Festival. She also performed supporting roles in the Festival's centerpiece opera, Campra's _Le Carnaval de Venise_. A frequent artist with The Haymarket Opera Company, she sang the role of the vengeful goddess, Juno in Marin Marais' _Ariane et Bachus_. Her performance was described as "wonderfully venomous" by the Chicago Tribune. In a departure from Baroque music, Ms. Schuller starred in the premiere performance of the newly formed company Theatre Comique in San Francisco. Presenting the works of Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert, she was hailed as "brilliant" by San Francisco Classical Voice. She appeared as the soprano soloist with Apollo's Fire in their presentation of G.F. Handel's _Israel in Egypt_, and joined the company again this Spring for their tour of a semi-staged production Monteverdi's _Orfeo_, singing the roles of La Musica and Euridice. Her performances were praised as "powerful" and "radiant."

​Recent projects of note include performances with Apollo's Fire, The Boston Early Music Festival, Ars Lyrica Houston, New Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Great Lakes Baroque and The Lincoln Trio.

​Additional past performances include the roles of Oriana in Handel's_Amadigi di Gaula_, Vespetta in Telemann's _Pimpinone_ and Lisetta in Scarlatti’s _Gli equivoci nel sembiante_, all with The Haymarket Opera Company; Livietta in Pergolesi’s _Livietta e Tracollo_ with the Boston Early Music Festival; Marzelline in Beethoven’s _Fidelio_ and Soprano 2 in Glass’s _Hydrogen Jukebox_ with Skylight Music Theater; she created the roles of Joan Strasinsky and The Princess for the world premiere of _The Snow Dragon_, by award winning novelist and composer Somtow Sucharitkul; Elvira in Rossini’s _L’italiana in Algeri_ and Second Woman in Purcell’s _Dido and Aeneas_ with The Florentine Opera Company.

As a concert soloist, Ms. Schuller has appeared with Apollo's Fire, Ars Lyrica Houston, New Trinity Baroque, Great Lakes Baroque, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Bach Choir, San Francisco Chamber Orchestra, Elgin Symphony Orchestra, Second City Musick and Bella Voce.

In addition to her work on the stage, Ms. Schuller can be heard as the voice of Marte in Duron’s _Salir el Amor del Mundo_, recorded for Dorian Record Label with Richard Savino and El Mundo. She can also be heard on the Boston Early Music Festival's Grammy-nominated recording of Lully’s opera _Psyché_.

​Originally from Wisconsin, Ms. Schuller received her Master of Music from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and holds degrees in Vocal Performance and Music Education from the Eastman School of Music. She currently lives and teaches in Chicago.
