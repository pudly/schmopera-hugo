American baritone John Chest is winner of the prestigious 2010 Stella Maris International Vocal Competition and the Arleen Auger Prize in the 2012 Hertogenbosch International Vocal Competition. Until September 2016 he was a member of the ensemble at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, where his roles included the title role of *Billy Budd* in a new production by David Alden, Valentin *Faust*, Ford *Falstaff*, Silvio *Pagliacci*, Figaro *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, Papageno *Die Zauberflöte*, Guglielmo *Così fan tutte*, and Il Conte Almaviva *Le nozze di Figaro*.

Recent engagements elsewhere include Albert *Werther* at the Théátre des Champs-Elysées, Nick Carraway *The Great Gatsby* (Staatsoper Dresden), Valentin *Faust* (Théâtre du Capitole Toulouse), the title role of *Don Giovanni* (Angers Nantes Opera), Marcello *La bohème* (Washington National Opera), Fritz *Die tote Stadt* (Nantes and Nancy), Nardo *La finta giardiniera* and Demetrius *A Midsummer Night's Dream* (both Aix-en-Provence), Eddie in Mark-Anthony Turnage's *Greek*, (Salzburg Landestheater), Ned Keene *Peter Grimes* (Norwegian Opera), Il Conte Almaviva *Le nozze di Figaro* (Nationale Reisopera), and Masetto *Don Giovanni* in Bari.

Chest is a graduate of the Opera Studio at the Bayerische Staatsoper, where he sang over eighty performances. He has held apprenticeships with the Santa Fe Opera and the Chicago Opera Theater, and took part in the prestigious Merola Opera Programme. He holds a master's degree in music from the Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University, where he studied with David Holloway.
