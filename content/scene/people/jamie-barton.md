Since winning both First and Song Prizes at the 2013 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, Jamie Barton has established herself as a major dramatic talent on both sides of the Atlantic. She was named as the recipient of the 2015 Richard Tucker Award, subsequently performing in a star-studded televised gala at Lincoln Center’s David Geffen Hall in the same year, and the Metropolitan Opera’s 2017 Beverly Sills Artist Award and she appeared as the featured soloist in The Last Night of The Proms 2019, broadcast live around the world on television and BBC Radio 3, conducted by Sakari Oramo. 

An impressive string of debuts continues this season with Ms Barton making her first appearance at Festival d’Aix en Provence in the role of Brangaene (_Tristan und Isolde_), conducted by Sir Simon Rattle. Further debut highlights in recent seasons include Azucena (_Il trovatore_) at Bayerische Staatsoper under Asher Fisch, Eboli (_Don Carlo_) at Deutsche Oper Berlin, concert performances as Leonor at Teatro Real Madrid and her Royal Opera House, Covent Garden debut as Fenena (_Nabucco_), alongside major new roles in the US such as Sara, Duchess of Nottingham (_Roberto Devereux_) for San Francisco Opera, Ježibaba (_Rusalka_) at The Met under Sir Mark Elder, and Sister Helen Prejean (_Dead Man Walking_) at Atlanta Opera. 

Jamie Barton made a welcome return to The Metropolitan Opera in two new roles last season – as Orfeo in Gluck’s _Orfeo ed Euridice_ under Mark Wigglesworth - a role she revisits in the current season at Dallas Opera - and Elisabetta in Donizetti’s _Maria Stuarda_ under Maurizio Benini, the latter of which was broadcast live in cinemas via The Met’s _Live in HD_ programme. She gave her first staged performances in new productions as Leonor (_La favorite_) for Houston Grand Opera.

On the concert stage, Jamie Barton has already collaborated with a number of major conductors including Marin Alsop for both Brahms’ _Alto Rhapsody_ with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in her BBC Proms debut and Bernstein’s Symphony No.1 Jeremiah for her London Symphony Orchestra debut, both Sir Andrew Davis and Sir Antonio Pappano for Verdi’s _Messa da Requiem_ with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden respectively, Patrick Summers for Mahler’s _Das Lied von der Erde_ at the Aspen Music Festival, and Alan Gilbert for Fricka with the New York Philharmonic. 

An outstanding recitalist, Jamie Barton has appeared at New York’s Carnegie Hall and the Tanglewood Festival. With pianist Kathleen Kelly, she has appeared in Zankel Hall, the Celebrity Series in Boston, Matinée Musicale Cincinnati, and at the Kennedy Center in Washington as part of Renée Fleming’s VOICES series. Last season Ms Barton debuted at Wigmore Hall with a new programme exploring the works of female composers and the portrayal of women by composers of both genders. Jamie Barton’s latest CD, _Unexpected Shadows_, is a collaboration with Jake Heggie and was released by Pentatone at the start of this season to unanimous critical acclaim.
