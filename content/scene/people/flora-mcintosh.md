Described by Opera Now as a mezzo soprano with "…a fabulously sexy voice of prodigious range", Flora McIntosh studied at the RNCM where she received generous support from the Peter Moores Foundation and the Countess of Munster Musical Trust. During her studies she won several awards including the Anne Ziegler Award and Ricordi Opera Prize. Flora now studies with Arwel Treharne Morgan; she is a Samling Artist and has participated in masterclasses with, amongst others, Malcolm Martineau, Jane Eaglen, Della Jones and Graham Vick.

Operatic experience includes the title role in *Carmen* (OperaUpClose, Opera Garden, Opera Brava, LFO), Donna Elvira (Regents Opera), Suzuki (Regents Opera), Octavian (Lambeth Orchestra), Cherubino (Opera a la Carte), Meg Page (Opera Garden), Judith in *Duke Bluebeard’s Castle* (RNCM), The Drummer in *The Emperor of Atlantis* (Halle and Imperial War Museum North), Masha in *Pique Dame* (RNCM), Dido/The Sorceress in *Dido and Aeneas* (Barnes Choral/Silk Opera), Suzanne in Butler’s *A Better Place* (RNCM), Dorabella (ETO cover), Papagena and 3rd Lady (ETO), Myrtale in *Thaïs* and 2nd Lady in *The Magic Flute* (Grange Park Opera), Idamante (New Sussex Opera and Forestbird Productions), Der Komponist and Hermia (excerpts for Clonter Opera) and Fanny Nelson/Emma Hamilton in the world premiere of Bawden’s *A Sailor’s Tale*. Flora made her international debut in Tre cantate per J S Bach at the Batignano Festival in Italy where she returned the following year with Handel’s cantata *Armida* Abbandonata. She has travelled to Venice and Monte Carlo with London Festival Opera and sang various roles in Ravel’s *L’enfant et les sortilèges* with the European Opera Centre in Greece and Cyprus.

Equally happy on the concert platform, Flora has sung in venues across the UK and Europe. Highlights include the Angel and the Queen in Mendelssohn’s *Elijah* alongside Sir Thomas Allen at Westminster Cathedral (Parliament Choir and SBS), Beethoven’s 9th Symphony with the Huddersfield Choral Society and recitals at The Forge, London. Flora has recorded for NMC and broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and BBC television.

Most recently: critically acclaimed Carmen at The Soho Theatre; Flora in *La Traviata* at The Soho Theatre and Tricycle Theatre, London; The Goddess of a the Sea in the world premiere of Ulla’s *Odyssey* at Kings Place, London; and Kate Pinkerton for Bury Court Opera.

Current and future plans include The Goddess of the Sea on tour; further performances of Carmen on tour; Romeo in Bellini’s *I Capuleti e I Montecchi* for Pop-Up Opera Spring Tour; Rosina for Pop -Up Summer/Autumn Tour; Judith in *Bluebeard’s Castle* for Northwall ArtsLab; Beatrice in *Music Oft Hath Such A Charm* for OperaUpClose and The Page in *Salome* with Kelvin Lim.
