Described by Opera Now as a mezzo soprano with "…a fabulously sexy voice of prodigious range", Flora McIntosh studied at the RNCM where she received generous support from the Peter Moores Foundation and the Countess of Munster Musical Trust. During her studies she won several awards including the Anne Ziegler Award and Ricordi Opera Prize. Flora now studies with Arwel Treharne Morgan; she is a Samling Artist and has participated in masterclasses with, amongst others, Malcolm Martineau, Jane Eaglen, Della Jones and Graham Vick.

Operatic experience includes the title role in *Carmen* (OperaUpClose, Opera Garden, Opera Brava, LFO), Donna Elvira (Regents Opera), Suzuki (Regents Opera), Octavian (Lambeth Orchestra), Cherubino (Opera a la Carte), Meg Page (Opera Garden), Judith in *Duke Bluebeard’s Castle* (RNCM), The Drummer in *The Emperor of Atlantis* (Halle and Imperial War Museum North), Masha in *Pique Dame* (RNCM), Dido/The Sorceress in *Dido and Aeneas* (Barnes Choral/Silk Opera), Suzanne in Butler’s *A Better Place* (RNCM), Dorabella (ETO cover), Papagena and 3rd Lady (ETO), Myrtale in *Thaïs* and 2nd Lady in *The Magic Flute* (Grange Park Opera), Idamante (New Sussex Opera and Forestbird Productions), Der Komponist and Hermia (excerpts for Clonter Opera) and Fanny Nelson/Emma Hamilton in the world premiere of Bawden’s *A Sailor’s Tale*.

She has travelled to Venice and Monte Carlo with London Festival Opera and sang various roles in Ravel’s *L’enfant et les sortilèges* with the European Opera Centre in Greece and Cyprus.
