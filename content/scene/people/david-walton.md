Praised for his “clean, clear voice,” David Walton dazzles stages across the country to critical acclaim. As Tybalt in the recent production of Gounod’s *Roméo et Juliette*, Mr. Walton was described as “the production’s only good villain ... a tightly coiled ball of restless anger” (The Pioneer Press). This season, he sings the title role in *Albert Herring* with Union Avenue Opera, a Summer in the Park concert with Madison Opera, *Salome* with Minnesota Orchestra, Ernesto in *Don Pasquale* with Minnesota Opera, as a soloist in “A Three Tenor Christmas” with Chanhassen Dinner Theater, Belmonte in *Die Entführung aus dem Serail* with Madison Opera and Brava! Opera Theatre, and Count Almaviva in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* with the Glimmerglass Festival.

Last season, Mr. Walton’s engagements included performing the role of Ernesto in *Don Pasquale* with Brava! Opera Theater, débuting the role of Silvio in a new production of the Lorenzo Da Ponte rarity: *L’arbore di Diana*, and covering Larry Renault in Minnesota Opera’s world première of William Bolcom’s *Dinner at Eight*. Recently in his final season of the Minnesota Opera Resident Artist Program, Mr. Walton performed an array of roles including Tamino in *Die Zauberflöte*, Ed Mavole in the world première of *Manchurian Candidate*, Brighella in *Ariadne auf Naxos*, Spoletta in *Tosca*, and Postiglione in *La fanciulla del West*. He also sang in the world première of Paul Moravec's *The Shining* as Delbert Grady where Opera News praised him as “equally chilling in his casual charm and suavity.”

Mr. Walton made his Glimmerglass Festival début in *La bohème* and Count Alberto in Rossini's *L'occasione fa il ladro*. He also covered Reverend Parris in Francesca Zambello’s staging of *The Crucible* and sang Frederic in a special excerpt from *The Pirates of Penzance* for special guest Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a member of their Young Artist Program. Other recent engagements include the title role in *Zémire et Azor* with Opera for the Young and Ernesto in *Don Pasquale* with Atlantic Music Festival. As a Gerdine Young Artist with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, he performed in *La rondine*, sang Belmonte in the Center Stage Concert with the Saint Louis Symphony, and covered the role of Matthew Gurney in Tobias Picker’s *Emmeline*. 

Recent concert highlights include the tenor solo in Händel's *Messiah* with the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra and Rogue Valley Symphony, Mendelssohn's *Lobgesang* with Lipscomb University, Cantata BWV 43 with Atlantic Music Festival, Rossini’s *Stabat Mater* at the Glimmerglass Festival, and Cantata BWV 88 with the Minnesota Bach Ensemble. Mr. Walton also performed theatrical roles including a Soldier in *All is Calm* with Theatre Latte Da & Cantus, Ned Poins in *Henry IV Pt. 1*, Lun Tha in *The King and I*, and Fenton in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* all with Oxford Shakespeare Festival.
