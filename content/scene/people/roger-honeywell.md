Canadian  tenor  Roger  Honeywell  has  been  acclaimed  by  Anthony  Tommasini  as  a  performer who brings “burnished sound and crisp diction to sweeping vocal lines, full of leaps and dips.” 

Honeywell studied at the Ryerson Theatre School in Toronto and began his career as an actor, working widely in his native country. He went on to become a member of the Canadian Opera Company’s Young Artists Programme, and in 2008 made his Metropolitan Opera, New York, debut as James Nolan (Doctor Atomic). His many appearances in the US and Canada include Bob Boles (Peter Grimes) for Canadian Opera Company, Bacchus (Ariadne auf Naxos) for Pacific Opera Victoria, Gabriel von Eisenstein (Die Fledermaus) for Vancouver Opera, Loge (Das Rheingold) for Opéra de Montréal, Captain Vere (Billy Budd) and Peter Grimes for Des Moines Metro Opera and in Santiago, Captain Ahab (Heggie’s Moby-Dick) for Pittsburgh Opera and Utah Opera, Dick Johnson (La fanciulla del West) for Virginia Opera and Glimmerglass Opera, Veasey (Cold Mountain) for North Carolina Opera, Archbishop Roche (the world premiere of John Estacio’s Ours) for Opera on the Avalon, Leukippos (Daphne) for Glimmerglass Opera, Troilus (Troilus and Cressida) with Opera Theatre of St Louis, James Nolan for Lyric Opera of Chicago and Danilo (Die lustige Witwe) for Boston Lyric Opera. European appearances include Charlie (Mahagonny-Songspiel) and Father (Die sieben Todsünden) for Opéra national du Rhin and Leukippos (Daphne) for Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse.

Honeywell has also sung in concert with the Montréal Symphony, Toronto Symphony, Calgary Philharmonic and with many other orchestras in his native Canada and the USA.
