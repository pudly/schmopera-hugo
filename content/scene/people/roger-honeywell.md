Tenor Roger Honeywell has been in constant demand for his unique and searing portrayals of opera’s most dynamic characters for over two decades. His commitment to new work and standard repertoire are given equal measure as he moves seamlessly between both. 

Roger began his career as an actor in his native Canada working at many of the country’s leading theatres including the Stratford Festival and the Shaw Festival. After a Dora award winning performance of The House of Martin Guerre in Toronto, he decided to make the leap into the world of Opera. He was fortunate to join the Canadian Opera Company in their young artist program, followed by two years with the Chicago Lyric’s renowned artists training program. 

Some of Roger’s most memorable performances include: Glenn Gould in Gould’s Wall (Tapestry Opera) for which he received a Dora nomination; Larry in A Thousand Acres (Des Moines Metro Opera); Shuisky in Boris Godunov (Royal Opera House, Covent Garden); Trajan in Hadrian (Canadian Opera Company) ; Loge in Das Rheingold (Operá de Montréal); Antonio in the Tempest( Opéra de Québec); Dick Johnson in La Fanciulla del West (Virginia Opera);  Captain Vere in Billy Budd (DMMO, Theatro Municipal do Rio, Teatro Municipal de Santiago); Captain Ahab in Moby Dick(Pittsburgh Opera, Utah Opera); Peter Grimes, (DMMO, Canadian Opera Company); The Father in Die Sieben Todsünden (Operá National du Rhine); Danilo in The Merry Widow (Lyric Opera of Chicago) and Captain James Nolan in the Grammy Award winning Dr. Atomic (Metropolitan Opera).

The excitement of creating a new role has been at the forefront of Roger’s focus.  The work with outstanding composers, librettists and directors has always been hugely rewarding. Some of these world premiers have been : A Thousand Acres (Kuster/Campbell) ; Goulds Wall (Current/Balkan) ; Cold Mountain (Higdon/Scheer) ; The Letter (Moravec/Teachout) ; Ours (Estacio/Chafe);  Hadrian (Wainwright/MacIvor);  Life is a Dream (Spratlan/Maraniss);  The Inventor (Tovey/Murell);  Lillian Alling (Estacio/Murell) ; The Grapes of Wrath (Ian-Gordon/Korie); Margaret Garner (Danielpour/Morrison).

Equally at home on the concert stage, Roger has sung with many of North America’s outstanding orchestras including the Toronto Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Calgary Symphony, Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Rhode Island Symphony, Orchestre Metropolitain de Montreal and many others.
