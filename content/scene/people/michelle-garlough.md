An Alberta native, Michelle grew up performing. She spent most of her early school years in dance classes and music lessons. By the time she was thirteen years old, she was singing in a professional children’s choir and seriously studying ballet, voice, and piano. It was during those years that she discovered her love for singing and the stage, and it hasn’t stopped since.

Michelle chose to advance her studies while completing both her Honours BMus and MMus in Voice Performance and Literature with Theodore Baerg at the University of Western Ontario. During her studies she performed contrasting roles in both operatic and cabaret repertoire where she could use both dance and vocal skills, including Ottone in *L’incoronazione di Poppea*, Mae Jones in *Street Scene*, Brenda in *Smokey Joe’s Café*, Cercatrice in *Suor Angelica*, and Lulu in *The Merry Widow*.

Michelle was the Best of Festival Rose Bowl winner in the Rotary Music Festival and earned a first place standing in the provincial festival for two consecutive years. She was also a finalist in the renowned International Eisteddfod Music festival in LLangollen, Wales.

Michelle currently resides in Toronto where she has founded the Amici School of Music with fellow singer Leigh-Ann Allen. There she enjoys teaching both piano and voice while specializing in early childhood music. Aside from teaching, Michelle recently performed as a soloist for Opera Toronto and for her Majesty the Queen at the St. James Anglican Cathedral. This season, Michelle is excited to be performing with Opera Five, The Heliconian Women’s Ensemble, Opera Toronto, and Opera in Concert.
