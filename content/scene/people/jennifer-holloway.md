	Lauded for her "nuanced dramatic impulses" and "voice that is liquid, lambent, and lit from within", American singer Jennifer Holloway gives new life to the characters she plays and the music she sings at leading opera houses and concert halls at home and abroad. This season brings exciting role debuts, including Rosina, Musetta, and Adalgisa, and her first appearances with the Canadian Opera Company (Elvira in Dmitri Tcherniakov's production of Don Giovanni) and Opera Philadelphia.

	Recent performances have met critical acclaim, including in her English National Opera debut as Orlofsky in Christopher Alden's striking production of <em>Die Fledermaus, </em>as well as a breakthrough performance in her South American debut at Argentina's Teatro Colón as Temple Drake in the World Premiere of Oscar Strasnoy's new opera, <em>Requiem, </em>and her return to the Metropolitan Opera for Tebaldo in Don Carlo, conducted by the late Lorin Maazel. Among the highlights of her concert work were her first appearances with the Marseille Philharmonic and Maestro Lawrence Foster in a concert tour around China, and with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra in a program including the world premiere of Frédéric Chaslin's <em>Love and a Question</em>, which he composed for her.<br>

	She has concentrated her repertory in major roles by Mozart and Handel, performing the roles of Dorabella in <em>Cosí fan tutte </em>(Dallas, Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York City Opera, Tokyo), Cherubino in <em>Le nozze di Figaro </em>(Dallas, Portland, Bordeaux), Idamante in <em>Idomeneo</em> (Opéra National de Bordeaux), Donna Elvira in <em>Don Giovanni</em> (Pittsburgh, Tulsa), Irene in <em>Tamerlano</em> (Teatro Real Madrid, Los Angeles Opera) and the title role in <em>Serse</em> (Pittsburgh). She made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York in December 2010 as Flora in Willy Decker's new production of <em>La Traviata,</em> and has also appeared at the Glyndebourne Festival in new productions of <em>Hänsel und Gretel</em> (Hänsel) and <em>Falstaff</em> (Meg Page), at the Santa Fe Opera in new productions of <em>Cendrillon</em> (Prince Charmant) and <em>Faust</em> (Siebel), the Maggio Musicale in Florence, the Théâtre du Capitole Toulouse (Rameau's <em>Hippolyte et Aricie</em> with Emmanuel Haïm), the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Opera Theater of St. Louis. Concert and festival appearances include the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles (Mercedes in <em>Carmen </em>with Gustavo Dudamel and Zweite Dame in <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>with Leonard Slatkin), Anne de Boleyn in Saint-Saëns rarely-performed <em>Henry VIII </em>at the Bard Music Festival with the American Symphony Orchestra (now available on itunes), as both Octavian and as Der Komponist in Chautauqua, NY, and at Chicago's Grant Park Music Festival in Rossini's <em>Stabat Mater</em>. She has also formed a strong partnership with Jean-Christophe Spinosi and his Ensemble Matheus in works by Rossini and Vivaldi.
