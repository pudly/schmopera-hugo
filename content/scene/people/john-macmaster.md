Since his astonishing portrayal of Canio in PAGLIACCI at Glimmerglass Opera, John Mac Master has been in demand at the highest international level for the dramatic tenor repertoire. Performances and recording projects include Florestan in FIDELIO with Sir Colin Davis in London, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with Sir Bernard Haitink (both with the London Symphony Orchestra) and his debut at Dresden’s Semper Oper as Calaf in TURANDOT conducted by Fabio Luisi. Mr. Mac Master’s acclaimed Metropolitan Opera début came as Canio in PAGLIACCI in performances that included the Saturday Afternoon ‘Live from the Met’ radio broadcast. Of particular note was his assumption of the role of Tristan in TRISTAN UND ISOLDE for Welsh National Opera conducted by Mark Wigglesworth and a subsequent outing at the Met in this demanding role, with Levine in the pit. His schedule has also included performances of Verdi’s REQUIEM at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa with Zukerman, Aegisth in ELEKTRA for the Canadian Opera Company, Janacek’s GLAGOLITIC MASS with William Eddins and the Edmonton Symphony plus PAGLIACCI and ARIADNE AUF NAXOS (both for Vancouver Opera).

Mr. Mac Master continues to be in demand for heroic repertoire and he has recently repeated a number of his signature roles including Florestan in FIDELIO for Edmonton Opera, and Herodes in SALOME with the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New Orleans Opera. On the concert stage he was featured in Mahler’s Symphony No. 8 with the Toronto Symphony, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 for the Seattle Symphony and the Victoria Symphony, and an Opera Gala for the Colorado Symphony.

Mahler’s Symphony No. 8 claimed his attention in Vancouver conducted by Tovey, followed by THE DREAM OF GERONTIUS with the Grand Philharmonic Choir, performances and a recording of EURYANTHE at Warsaw’s Beethoven Festival and the title role in OTELLO for Edmonton Opera. He was heard at Ottawa’s National Arts Centre and in Montréal at Place des Arts with Nézet-Séguin in Mahler’s Symphony No. 8 and in Verdi’s REQUIEM for Orchestre Symphonique de Québec.
