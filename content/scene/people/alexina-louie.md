	One of Canadaʼs most sought after composers, Alexina Louie has written for many of<br>
	the countryʼs leading soloists, chamber ensembles, new music ensembles and orchestras. Her works have become part of the standard repertoire, in particular her many compositions for piano which are frequently performed by students and professionals alike. Perhaps best known of these is <em>Scenes From A Jade Terrace</em>, commissioned by Jon Kimura Parker, who recently celebrated the 20th Anniversary of its composition with a tour of Canada and the United States.

	Ms. Louie's orchestral works have received important performances by such renowned<br>
	conductors as Sir Andrew Davis, Leonard Slatkin, Alexander Lazarev, Charles Dutoit,<br>

	Carlos Kalmar, James Judd, and Ingo Metzmacher.

	Her major theatrical works include <em>The Scarlet Princess</em>, a full-length opera with libretto by Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang (<em>M. Butterﬂy</em>) commissioned by the Canadian Opera Company and premiered in concert (2002), and <em>Wolfʼs Court</em>, commissioned by The National Ballet of Canada, created with choreographer Matjash Mrozewski and premiered in June 2007 at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto.
