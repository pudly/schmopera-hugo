A former member of the San Francisco Opera’s prestigious Merola Opera Program and recipient of the "Best Singer Award" by the 2011 Austin Critics’ Table for his performance in *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat*, Matthew Treviño is proving to be one of today’s most sought-after young basses. The *San Francisco Chronicle* described his recent performances as Don Basilio (*Il barbiere di Siviglia*) as "sonorous and neatly malevolent" with *The New York Times* praising his "delightfully unctuous portrayal."  

Engagements for last season included Sparafucile in *Rigoletto* with Vancouver Opera and Hawaii Opera Theatre, Colline in *La bohème* with Opera Coeur d’Alene, Ashby in *La fanciulla del West* with Opera Omaha, the King in *Aïda* with Utah Opera, Leporello in *Don Giovanni* with Intermountain Opera, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the Brevard Symphony Orchestra, and Barone Douphol in *La traviata* with the Shippensburg Music Festival. The 2016-2017 season includes *La bohème* with the Colorado Symphony, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the Santa Fe Symphony, a reprise of his Monterone in *Rigoletto* with Palm Beach Opera, and returns to Nashville Opera and Brooklyn Academy of Music for Three Way and Opera Colorado as Raimondo in *Lucia di Lammermoor*.
 
Other recent highlights include his company debut in *Peter Grimes* and *Rigoletto* with the English National Opera, the title character in Gordon Getty’s new opera *The Canterville Ghost* in Leipzig, *La bohème* for the Florentine Opera, *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* with the Nashville Opera, *Don Giovanni* for Opera Colorado, *Rigoletto* for the Lyric Opera Baltimore and Opera Memphis, and a debut with the Saint Louis Symphony (Messiah) under Christopher Warren-Green.

Other appearances have included Pistola (*Falstaff*) for Opera Cleveland, Nourabad (*Les pêcheurs de perles*) for Syracuse Opera, Sparafucile (*Rigoletto*) for San Antonio Opera, and Colline (*La bohème*) for Opera Carolina, Lyric Opera of Kansas City and Fresno Grand Opera. He has performed the roles of Angelotti (*Tosca*), Ramfis (*Aida*), and Commendatore (*Don Giovanni*), and, under the auspices of the San Francisco Opera’s Merola Opera Program, Simone (*Gianni Schicchi*), Basilio (*Il barbiere di Siviglia*) and Don Alfonso (*Così fan tutte*). Most recently he appeared as Timur (*Turandot*) at Austin Lyric Opera, the King (*Aïda*) for Arizona Opera, Baron Douphol (*La traviata*) at Nashville Opera, Sarastro (*Die Zauberflöte*) with the Opera Theatre Company in Ireland and he made his role debut as Don Giovanni with Opera Naples.
 
Highly regarded for his acting and in particular for his comedic Gilbert and Sullivan performances, Mr. Treviño has appeared as Dick Deadeye (*H.M.S. Pinafore*) at Lyric Opera of Kansas City and at Opera Carolina and the Sergeant of Police (*The Pirates of Penzance*) at the Fresno Grand Opera.
 
Mr. Treviño is a graduate of Baylor University in Waco, Texas and was a finalist in the Loren L. Zachary Foundation Competition, Dallas Opera Guild Competition, Fort Worth Opera’s McCammon Voice Competition, Shreveport Opera’s Singer of the Year Competition, and the recipient of the Thomas Stewart Award for Vocal Excellence at Baylor University.
