Niagara Falls-born Soprano Kelsey Vicary is a young performer praised for her unique vocal timbre, dramatic intensity, and “impressive musicality” (*Opera Canada*). She is quickly establishing herself with audiences at home and abroad as a powerful performer.  This season she debuts in concert with the Guelph Symphony Orchestra, with Essential Opera in Toronto, ON, and returns to the Windsor Symphony for Mozart’s *Coronation Mass* and for *Messiah* later in 2015.
 
In the past year, Ms. Vicary has debuted with the Boise Philharmonic Orchestra as the soprano soloist in Handel’s *Messiah*, with the Windsor Symphony as Micaela in *Carmen*, with Metro Youth Opera as The Mother in *Hansel and Gretel*, and with the Opera on the Avalon Festival as Helena in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*. Her other roles include Fiordiligi (*Così fan Tutte*), Mimì (*La Bohème*), Countess (*Le Nozze di Figaro*), Suor Felicite (*Dialogues des Carmélites*), and the title role in *L’incoronazione di Poppea*. In concert, she has appeared as the soprano soloist in Bach’s *Weihnachts-Oratorium* with Atelier S, with the Boise Philharmonic Orchestra, with the Grand River Chorus in Brantford, Ontario, and in aria galas with the Opera on the Avalon Orchestra, Orchestra London, the St. Andrews Arts Council, and the Cathedral Bluffs Symphony Orchestra in Scarborough, Ontario.  She was a past finalist in the COC Ensemble Competition, and winner of the Brantford GRC Spotlight on Youth Competition in 2013.  
 
In addition to holding a MMus from Western University, Kelsey has trained at the 2014 Opera Workshop in St. Andrews NB, Opera on the Avalon, Summer Opera Lyric Theatre (SOLT), Halifax Summer Opera Workshop, the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy (COSI), Accademia Europa dell’Opera (AEDO), the Canadian Operatic Arts Academy (COAA), and the Songfest Festival. She currently studies in Toronto with Nathalie Paulin.
