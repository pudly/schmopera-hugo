Praised by Opera News as “the kind of performer who makes it all look easy,” Heather Buck is best described by opera critic David Shengold as “a lithe and impactful actress with an uncommonly beautiful soprano for the high-lying and testing repertory she serves." In the 2019-20 season, she sings Leïla in _Les pêcheurs de perles_ with Opera in Williamsburg, Herodiade in Stradella’s _San Giovanni Battista_ with Opera Omaha, Louis Karchin’s _Four Songs on Poems by Seamus Heaney_ at the Bowling Green New Music Festival, and _Carmina Burana_ with Symphony of Northwest Arkansas and West Virginia Symphony.

In the 2018-19 season, Ms. Buck sang Susanna in Laura Elise Schwendinger’s _Artemisia_ at the Time’s Arrow Festival of Trinity Church Wall Street, a reprise of the title role of Charles Wuorinen’s _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ with Boston Modern Orchestra Project, and Four Songs on Poems by Seamus Heaney with Orchestra of the League of Composers. Her 2017-18 season included returns to New York City Opera to reprise the title role in Argento’s monodrama _Miss Havisham’s Wedding Night_, and Alma Beers in Wuorinen’s _Brokeback Mountain_, a role she first created with Teatro Real Madrid; to Odyssey Opera as Joan of Arc in Dello Joio’s _The Trial at Rouen_; and to Virginia Opera as Tytania in _A Midsummer’s Night Dream_. She sang as Merteuil in Luca Francesconi's _Quartett_ with West Edge Opera in the summer of 2018.

Ms. Buck recently made her LoftOpera debut in a staged production of Pergolesi’s _Stabat Mater_, and created the role of Ku in Paola Prestini’s _Gilgamesh_ with Beth Morrison Projects, and Persephone in Wachner’s Rev. 23 at the Prototype Festival. Other recent engagements include Philip Glass’ Symphony No. 5, with both the Washington Chorus at the Kennedy Center and Trinity Church Wall Street; Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children and the American premiere of Lachenmann’s _The Little Match Girl_ at Spoleto Festival USA; and a reprise of the Maid in Adès’ _Powder Her Face_ with Teatro Arriaga Antzokia, Bilbao, a role she originally sang in the work’s U.S. premiere and filmed for the BBC.
