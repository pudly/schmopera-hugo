Lars Fischer grew up in Hergiswil (Switzerland) and Djursholm (Sweden). He holds a BLaw from the University of Lucerne (Switzerland, 2012), a BA in Music from the Lucerne School of Music with Prof. Hans-Jürg Rickenbacher (2015) and recently graduated from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance with an MMus with Distinction under the tutelage of Sophie Grimmer and Rob Bottriell.

Most recently, Lars performed the roles of Gronw in _Her Face was of Flowers_ (E. Jones) at Tête-à-tête Opera Festival, Achille in _La Belle Hélène_ (J. Offenbach) with Blackheath Halls Opera, Monostatos in _Die Zauberflöte_ (W. A. Mozart) with Hurn Court Opera, King of the West and Sun in _The Enchanted Pig_ (J. Dove) with Hampstead Garden Opera, Marley’s Ghost in _A Christmas Carol_ (T. Musgrave), King Kaspar in _Amahl and the Night Visitors_ (G. C. Menotti) and Lucano in _L’incoronazione di Poppea_ (C. Monteverdi) with Trinity Laban Opera. In June 2016, he created the role of Tommy in the world premiere of Stephen McNeff’s opera _Banished at Blackheath Halls_ with Jessica Cottis (musical director) and Elaine Kidd (director). Roles performed in scenes include Julien (_Louise_, G. Charpentier), Dr Caius (_Falstaff_, G. Verdi), Chevalier des Grieux (_Manon_, J. Massenet), La Théière (_L’Enfant et les Sortilèges_, M. Ravel), Soldier in _L’incoronazione di Poppea_ and Triquet in _Eugene Onegin_ (P. Tchaikovsky). Lars was also a finalist in the Lilian Ash French Song Duo Competition 2016 with Neus Peris and in the Elisabeth Schumann Lieder Competition 2019 with Andrea Emanuele at Trinity Laban Conservatoire.

During his time at Trinity Laban, Lars was part of the newly formed vocal ensemble Rubythroat led by Dr. Linda Hirst, with whom he performed Luciano Berio’s _A-ronne_ and _Cries of London_, Arnold Schönberg’s _Friede auf Erden_ and settings of Wiliam Blake poems by Julian Marshall alongside tenor James Gilchrist. He has sung in masterclasses held by Nicky Spence, James Gilchrist, Dr. Ron Morris, Veronica Veysey-Campbell, Liza Hobbs, Tatiana Korsunskaya and has worked with directors such as Elaine Kidd, Laura Attridge, Harry Fehr, Stuart Barker, James Hurley and Matthias Behrends. Important musical influences include Graham Johnston, Eugene Asti, Edward Rushton and Derek Aviss.

With great interest and dedication, Lars has a focus on the German and Swedish romantic song repertoire. This was reflected in his bachelor’s recital project at the Lucerne School of Music with the title Nordic Legends and Myths. He regularly works with his duo partners Neus Peris, Miduo Zhuge and Andrea Emanuele.

Most recently, he made his debut as assistant director to Laura Attridge for Trinity Laban Opera’s production of _The Rape of Lucretia_ (B. Britten).

Lars was the Crompton Scholar and a Kathleen Roberts Vocal Scholar (Trinity Laban Conservatoire) and a member of the Swiss Study Foundation. Prior to his music studies, Lars completed a Bachelor’s degree in Law at the University of Lucerne (magna cum laude). He then worked as a tutorial assistant to Prof. Dr. Jürg-Beat Ackermann (chair of Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law at the University of Lucerne) and gained valuable experience in academic work and as a proofreader. Since 2006, he has been very active in various positions for the Swiss Guide and Scout Movement.

During his studies, Lars was graciously supported by the Swiss Study Foundation, Haiku-Stiftung, Ignaz Staub Stiftung, Minerva Kunststiftung, Schüller-Stiftung and Rita Zimmermann Musik-Stiftung.
