Rising mezzo-soprano Angela Brower was raised in Arizona and studied at the Arizona State University and at the Indiana University. In addition to earning several awards and prizes during her studies, she performed at the Glimmerglass Opera as a part of the 2008 "Young American Artists Program".  From there she was invited into the Junges Ensemble of the Bayerische Staatsoper where she was a member from 2008 to 2010. Her portrayal of Dorabella (*Così fan tutte*) earned her particular attention on the main stage of the Nationaltheater.

The 16/17 season begins with Ms. Brower making her Royal Opera House debut as Dorabella in the new production of Mozart’s *Così fan tutte* under the direction of Semyon Bychkov. She then returns to Munich singing Cherubino opposite Diana Damrau’s Countess in *Le nozze di Figaro*. Ms. Brower will then travel to the States where she will sing alongside star tenor Rolando Villazón with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in their annual Christmas Concert, then debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra as a soloist in Handel’s *Messiah*, and finally return home to Arizona where she will give a recital with renowned guitarist, Judicaël Perroy as a part of the Tucson Guitar Society Recital Series.

Returning to Munich, Ms. Brower makes her anticipated performances as Octavian in *Der Rosenkavalier* at the Bavarian State Opera, under the direction of Kirill Petrenko. She will then debut the role of Elisabetta in *Maria Stuarda* in Klagenfurt and make her company debut at Glyndebourne singing Komponist in *Ariadne auf Naxos*. Ms. Brower finishes the season singing her celebrated role of Nicklausse in the Richard Jones production of *Les Contes d’Hoffmann* at the Bavarian State Opera.

Notable roles for the Munich’s Bavarian State Opera have included both Annio and Sesto in *La Clemenza di Tito*, Der Komponist in *Ariadne auf Naxos*, Angelina in *La Cenerentola*, Hänsel in *Hänsel und Gretel*, most recently Charlotte in *Werther*, and Adalgisa in *Norma*. In 2013, Angela Brower made her San Francisco Opera debut as Nicklausse in *Les Contes d’Hoffmann*, and returned for the 14/15 season to sing Cherubino. Previous seasons have also seen Ms Brower in roles such as Octavian in Klagenfurt, and as Siebel in a new production of *Faust* directed by Barlett Sher at the Baden-Baden Festspielhaus.

On the concert stage, she has been performing works such as Alban Berg’s *Sieben frühe Lieder* with the Tiroler Symphonie Orchester in Innsbruck, and with the NDR, Chausson’s *Poème de l’amour et de la mer* op. 19, and Ravel’s *Shéhérazade* under the direction of Yal Pascal Tortilier.

Angela Brower made her first recording in 2013, appearing as Dorabella in a complete recording of Mozart’s *Così fan tutte*, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin which was released by Deutsche Grammophon the following year to much critical acclaim. Ms. Brower returned to Baden-Baden in the summer of 2015 to record again under the direction of Maestro Nézet-Séguin with Deutsche Grammophon, this time as Cherubino in *Le Nozze di Figaro*.
