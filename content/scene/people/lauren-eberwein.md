Canadian-American settler Lauren Pearl (she/they) is a non-conforming interdisciplinary artist known for her “luscious, rich tone” (_Opera Canada_), “robust, dramatic voice” (_BroadwayWorld_), and for her reputation as “an artist of subtle skill” (Classical CD Choice). Lauren’s mission as a performer is to inspire and invigorate. They strive to question and disrupt conditioned models and structures in order to support equity and inclusivity. Now is the time to be fully present, reconnect with our source, and inspire empathetic awareness through art. Lauren hopes to do this through an interdisciplinary approach to performance art, by blending crafts to engage and welcome audiences through the use of a dynamic artistic spectrum.

Lauren’s adaptable instrument and versatile stage presence allow them to be a chameleon on stage; their repertoire ranges from Baroque to Wagnerian and everything between and beyond. Equally comfortable on both the operatic and concert stages, Lauren has made debuts across North America and Europe. Notable Canadian collaborations include performances with the Hornby Island Festival; interdisciplinary concerts with Echo Chamber Toronto; a fabulous and inspiring run as Bino in Against the Grain Theatre’s modern adaptation of _Le Nozze di Figaro: Figaro’s Wedding_; and numerous engagements with the Canadian Opera Company, including the self-produced _Les Adieux_, a performance of Messiaen’s transformational song cycle _Poèmes pour Mí_, in which pianist Rachael Kerr and Lauren brought the music to life while Lauren painted by hand on a stage of canvas. Lauren Pearl is grateful for the community in Toronto, both on and off the stage.

An avid and passionate chamber musician, Lauren has held residencies at the Marlboro Music Festival, Chamberfest Cleveland, and the New York Festival of Song. They regularly collaborate with Echo Chamber Toronto and look forward to an upcoming international tour with Musicians from Marlboro. Lauren trained in the Ensemble Studio with the Canadian Opera Company, as an Emerging Artist with Opera Philadelphia, and is a graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music.
