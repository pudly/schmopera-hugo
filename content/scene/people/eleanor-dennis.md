Scottish soprano Eleanor Dennis is a graduate of the Royal College of Music's International Opera School and a Harewood Artist at the English National Opera where her roles have so far included Contessa *Le nozze di Figaro* and Micaela *Carmen*.

Highlights in her 2016/17 season include Contessa for her debut with Scottish Opera and Helena in staged performances of *A Midsummer Night's Dream* at the Aldeburgh Festival.

On the concert platform, her engagements include Brahms' *Ein Deutsches Requiem* (CBSO/Andrew Manze), Beethoven's *Christus am Ölberge* (Bamberger Symphoniker/Rolf Beck), Britten's *A Spring Symphony* (Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra/Cornelius Meister & BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra/Ilan Volkov), *Elijah* (Three Choirs Festival), Haydn's Harmoniemesse (Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra/Sir András Schiff), Elgar's *Une Voix dans le Désert* (CBSO/Andris Nelsons), Beethoven's *Egmont* (BBC Philharmonic/Juanjo Mena), Beethoven's *Missa Solemnis* (Three Choirs Festival) and Strauss' *Vier Letzte Lieder* (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra/Martyn Brabbins).  She has also appeared with the London Philharmonic Orchestra/Vladimir Jurowski, the Early Opera Company/Christian Curnyn and the Swedish Radio Orchestra/Daniel Harding. 

Her appearances at the London Handel Festival first brought her to prominence, and it was in the title role of *Rodelinda* that she made her first major break-through.  The critics were unanimous in their praise.  Fiona Maddocks, reviewing her performance in *The Observer*, wrote 'she has a marvelous future. I'm not sure I can ever remember one who so obviously deserves to be a star'.  In the 2012 Festival she appeared as Costanza Riccardo Primo prompting Hugh Canning to call her 'a big talent' and, in 2013, she returned to the Festival to sing Oresia in a performance of Telemann's *Orpheus* with Ian Page and Classical Opera (of which she is an Associate Artist).
