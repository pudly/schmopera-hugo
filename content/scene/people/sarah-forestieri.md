Other performances have included a variety of traditional and contemporary art song in Los Angeles, where she participated as a Schubert Fellow at the Songfest Art song Festival. This past summer, she studied at Poetry and Performance of German Lied at the Franz-Schubert Institute, working with master teachers such as Elly Ameling, Julius Drake, Robert Holl, and Roger Vignoles, to name a few.

This November, Sarah will be appearing as a soloist in *Waltz Rivals* with Toronto Operetta Theatre, featuring the music of Imre Kálmán and Franz Lehár.
