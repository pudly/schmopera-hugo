Recent roles include Leporello in *Don Giovanni* (which he has performed at the Hawaii Performing Arts Festival and Queen City Opera), Don Basilio in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* (which he has performed internationally with La Compagnia di BelCanto di Milano and also with New York City's Christman Opera Company), Sarastro in *Die Zauberflöte* (which he has performed as a young artist with the Glimmerglass Festival), and Ramfis in *Aïda* (which he covered at the Glimmerglass Festival).
