Recent roles include Leporello in *Don Giovanni* (which he has performed at the Hawaii Performing Arts Festival and Queen City Opera), Don Basilio in *Il barbiere di Siviglia* (which he has performed internationally with La Compagnia di BelCanto di Milano and also with New York City's Christman Opera Company), Sarastro in *Die Zauberflöte* (which he has performed as a young artist with the Glimmerglass Festival), and Ramfis in *Aïda* (which he covered at the Glimmerglass Festival).

He also developed and performed the role of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Glimmerglass Festival's workshop of the 2015 revised edition of Philip Glass' *Appomattox*. Mr. Acon has also joined the NY Harlem Productions' 2016 & 2017 tours of *Porgy and Bess*, making his debuts at Semperoper Dresden, Hamburgische Staatsoper, Deutsches Theater München, Kölner Philharmonie, Alte Oper Frankfurt, Haifa Congress Center, Tel-Aviv Charles Bronfman Hall, and Teatro Petruzzelli di Bari in the roles of Jake and Jim.

Mr. Acon has fulfilled young artist residencies with the Glimmerglass Festival, Des Moines Metro Opera, Opera Theatre of St. Louis, La Musica Lirica International Festival, Opera North, Music Academy of the West, Chautauqua Music Festival, and the Wesley Balk Opera/Music-Theater Institute.

Mr. Acon has also placed as both a Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions regional finalist and encouragement award winner in 2011 and 2015.
