Hailed by The Boston Globe as “glowing,” “incandescent,” and “a singing actress to be reckoned with,” American soprano Jacquelyn Stucker is being recognized internationally as a versatile singer of new and interesting repertoire ranging from concert works to opera to contemporary music. Praised for her “dark-tinged soprano with a dusky lower register,” Jacquelyn will begin her second year as a Jette Parker Young Artist at The Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. This season at Covent Garden, Jacquelyn will perform Prilepa in _The Queen of Spades_ with Antonio Pappano conducting, Aphrodite in Henze’s _Phaedra_, and Alessandro in Handel’s _Berenice_. She will also cover Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ with John Eliot Gardiner conducting, and will reprise Frasquita in Barrie Kosky’s _Carmen_.

In the autumn of 2019, Jacquelyn will make her Glyndebourne debut as Armida in Robert Carsen’s production of _Rinaldo_, and she will then make her principal artist debut at Deutsche Oper Berlin as Gretel in _Hansel und Gretel_ and Pamina in _Die Zauberflöte_. Last season, she made both her Covent Garden Debut and her Bayerische Staatsoper debut as Azema in David Alden’s new production of _Semiramide_. She also performed as Frasquita in Barrie Kosky’s production of _Carmen_ and the production will be broadcast worldwide in March 2018 as part of the Royal Opera House’s Live Cinema Season. She was featured in recital through The Royal Opera House; a solo recital of UK premieres of music by John Harbison, Federico Favali, and Mark Kilstofte; a performance of Bach "Ich habe genug" with The Royal Opera House Orchestra, conducted by James Hendry; and a recital with baritone Dominic Sedgwick and pianist David Gowland of Wolf’s _Italienisches Liederbuch_.

She was a finalist in the London Handel Society Solo Competition and the second-place prize-winner of the inaugural Glyndebourne Opera Cup. Highlights of Jacquelyn’s 2016-17 season included the soprano solos in Beethoven’s _Missa Solemnis_ with John Nelson and the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica, Beethoven’s “Ah, perfido!” with Grand Harmonie, the soprano solos in works by Graupner and Bach with the Handel and Haydn Society and Ian Watson, the roles of Gabriel and Eva in _Die Schöpfung_ with the Back Bay Chorale and Scott Allen Jarrett, the soprano solos in Tippett’s _A Child of Our Time_ with Andrew Clark and the Harvard Choruses, and her Santa Fe Opera principal artist debut as Oberto in _Alcina_ with Harry Bicket.

Also at the Santa Fe Opera in 2017, Jacquelyn covered the role of Rosalinde in _Die Fledermaus_. In addition to singing in the premiere performance of James Kallembach’s sacred cantata _The Most Sacred Body of Jesus_, Jacquelyn is the soprano soloist for a commercial recording of the work, scheduled for release in the autumn of 2017. In addition to frequently performing as a soloist throughout the season with the Handel and Haydn Society, Jacquelyn was featured as the 2016-17 soprano in the Society’s Educational Outreach Quartet. She is also the recipient of the 2016 Anna Case MacKay Career Advancement Grant from the Santa Fe Opera, a semi-finalist in the 2016 Young Concert Artists International Auditions, and a National Semi-Finalist in the 2017 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

Stucker enjoys an active academic career, and she graduated summa cum laude with her Doctorate of Musical Arts from New England Conservatory in May 2017. She also is an avid translator: she holds ILR Level 3 Translation Ability from German to English, she earned the B1 Zertifikat from the Goethe Institut, and her translation and phonetic transcription of Alban Berg’s _Wozzeck_ will be commercially available in the summer of 2019 from Pendragon Press. She graduated with highest honors from Bard College Conservatory’s Vocal Arts Program, under the artistic direction of soprano Dawn Upshaw and pianist Kayo Iwama. Stucker is incredibly passionate when it comes to raising awareness about lung disease, and she works at the Foundation as the Events and Community Team Volunteer.
