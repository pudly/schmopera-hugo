American baritone Jarrett Ott was recently named one of twenty-five “Rising Stars” by Opera News, who described his voice in *Cold Mountain* as having an, “often ravishing, airy vocal finish...he brought the testing role not only lovely, Pelléas-like sound but a deep investment in the words.” In his continued career ascension, Mr. Ott will make many important role debuts, including Papageno in *Die Zauberflöte* with Opera Philadelphia as part of their inaugural O17 festival, Figaro in *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* with Lyric Opera Kansas City and Dayton Opera, Jupiter in Offenbach’s *Orpheus in the Underworld* with New Orleans Opera, and at Santa Fe Opera, Harlekin and Maximilian in *Ariadne auf Naxos* and Candide, respectively. Important concert debuts include *Carmina Burana* with Seattle Symphony, Brahms’ *Requiem* with Columbus Symphony and Stanford’s Songs of the Fleet with the New York Choral Society at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Ott will join the Ensemble of Staatsoper Stuttgart beginning in 2018-2019. 

In the 2016-17 season, Mr. Ott made his major European opera debut at Deutsche Oper Berlin singing the role of the Angel in Andrea Scartazzini’s world premiere work *Edward II*, directed by Christoph Loy, and embarked on a European tour with Perm Opera and Music Aeterna as Don Pedro de Alvorado in a concert version of Purcell’s *Indian Queen*, with stops in Geneva, Köln, Bremen and Dortmund. In North America, Mr. Ott made three important role debuts: as Curly in *Oklahoma!* with Glimmerglass Festival, Zurga in *Pearl Fishers* with North Carolina Opera and Charlie in Jake Heggie’s *Three Decembers* with Opera Memphis. Concert engagements included debuts with Colorado Springs Philharmonic in *Carmina Burana*, a holiday concert with the Lexington Philharmonic and The Hyland Mass, a world-premiere with the New York Choral Society at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. 

In the 2015-16 season, Jarrett performed W.P. Inman in the East Coast premiere of *Cold Mountain* with Opera Philadelphia as well as the Marchese D’Obigny in *La Traviata*. He made his European concert debut with the Ensemble Intercontemporain in Paris, performing pieces by Vito Zuraj and Bach, conducted by Matthias Pintscher. Other role debuts included The Count in Strauss’ *Capriccio*, a co-production with Opera Philadelphia and Curtis Opera Theatre, Masetto in *Don Giovanni* with The Santa Fe Opera, as well as the Center for Contemporary Opera in Kenneth Fuchs’ *Falling Man* at Symphony Space in New York City. On the concert stage, he presented several recitals in North America under the auspices of The Brooklyn Art Song Society and appeared as a soloist in Handel’s Israel in Egypt with the New York Choral Society at Carnegie Hall.

In the summer of 2015, he was part of Santa Fe Opera’s Apprentice Program, singing Marullo in *Rigoletto* and covering Inman in the world premiere of Jennifer Higdon’s *Cold Mountain*. 

An avid recitalist and concert artist, Mr. Ott spent two seasons as a young artist at Marlboro Music and has made debuts with the New York Choral Society and the Bucks County Choral Society. He is a frequent soloist with Philadelphia’s LyricFest, and in the fall of 2011 he traveled to both China and South Korea with the Curtis Chamber Orchestra.
