Passionate, prolific, and complicated, composer David Lang embodies the restless spirit of invention. Lang is at the same time deeply versed in the classical tradition and committed to music that resists categorization, constantly creating new forms.

Lang is one of America’s most performed composers. Many of his works resemble each other only in the fierce intelligence and clarity of vision that inform their structures. His catalogue is extensive, and his opera, orchestra, chamber and solo works are by turns ominous, ethereal, urgent, hypnotic, unsettling and very emotionally direct. Much of his work seeks to expand the definition of virtuosity in music — even the deceptively simple pieces can be fiendishly difficult to play and require incredible concentration by musicians and audiences alike.

Lang’s [simple song #3](http://davidlangmusic.com/music/simple-song-3-from-soundtrack-to-youth), written as part of his [score for Paolo Sorrentino’s acclaimed film YOUTH](http://www.bangonacansound.com/music-from-youth), received many awards nominations in 2016, including the Academy Award and Golden Globe.

His opera [_prisoner of the state _](http://davidlangmusic.com/music/prisoner-of-state)(with libretto by Lang) was co-commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, Rotterdam’s De Doelen Concert Hall, London’s Barbican Centre, Barcelona’s l’Auditori, Bochum Symphony Orchestra, and Bruges’s Concertgebouw, and premiered June 2019 in New York, conducted by Jaap van Zweden. _prisoner of the state_ received its UK premiere in January 2020 with the BBC Symphony. The other European premieres were upended by the Covid-19 pandemic, and are [now re-scheduled for 2023](https://davidlangmusic.com/events-category/prisoner-of-the-state/) beginning May 17 in Bochum, Germany and continuing to De Doelen in Rotterdam (Netherlands) on May 20, the Concertgebouw Bruges (Belgium) on May 23, the Malmö Opera (Sweden) on June 2, and L’Auditori de Barcelona (Spain) on July 22.

Lang’s new chamber opera [_note to a friend_](https://davidlangmusic.com/music/note-to-a-friend/) premieres January 12 at the [Japan Society in New York as part of the 2023 PROTOTYPE Festival.](https://davidlangmusic.com/events/note-to-a-friend-performed-by-theo-bleckmann-and-japan-society-string-quartet/) With music and libretto by Lang, note to a friend combines and reimagines three texts by Japanese novelist Ryunosuke Akutagawa — his story “Death Register,” the last chapter of his “In a Grove,” and his suicide note “Note to a Certain Old Friend” — as a monodrama that addresses the eternal human fascination with death, love, family and suicide. Paris-based director Yoshi Oida leads the world premiere production, which stars Theo Bleckmann; an ensemble of Japanese musicians selected by Tokyo Bunka Kaikan perform the score. _note to a friend_ is a co-commission of Japan Society and Tokyo Bunka Kaikan, where it is performed from February 4–5.

2022 has included several noteworthy premieres. [_sun-centered_](https://davidlangmusic.com/music/sun-centered/) for the Tallis Scholars — a large scale choral work designed to share a program with Antoine Brumel’s monumental Renaissance mass for 12 voices Missa Et ecce terræ motus (“and the Earth moved”); [Song of Songs](https://davidlangmusic.com/music/song-of-songs/), a new evening-length work for Pam Tanowitz Dance, commissioned by the Fisher Center at Bard College and touring internationally in 2023; [_flower, forget me_](https://davidlangmusic.com/music/flower-forget-me/), a song cycle for the noted baritone Benjamin Appl, and [_composition as explanation_](https://davidlangmusic.com/music/composition-as-explanation/), a fully staged reimagination of a 1926 lecture by Gertrude Stein, for the chamber ensemble Eighth Blackbird, directed by the acclaimed Anne Bogart.

Lang’s film work includes the score to Paolo Sorrentino’s YOUTH, and for Jonathan Parker’s (Untitled), the music for the award-winning documentary The Woodmans, and the string arrangements for Requiem for a Dream, performed by the Kronos Quartet. His music is also on the soundtrack for Paolo Sorrentino’s Oscar-winning La Grande Bellezza.

Lang is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the Pulitzer Prize, an Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, Musical America’s Composer of the Year, Carnegie Hall’s Debs Composer’s Chair, the Rome Prize, the BMW Music-Theater Prize (Munich), and grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1999, he received a Bessie Award for his music in choreographer Susan Marshall’s The Most Dangerous Room in the House, performed live by the Bang on a Can All-Stars at the Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
