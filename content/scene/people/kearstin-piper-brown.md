Kearstin Piper Brown, praised for her "thrilling singing" (_Opera Now_) and recognized as "a rising talent to watch" back in 2007 (_The Cincinnati Enquirer_) has become one of the most sought-after lyric sopranos in the US.

In 2024, she makes her company debuts with Florida Grand Opera as Nedda as well as with the Metropolitan Opera as Evelyn in _Fire Shut up in My Bones_. She will also perform the world premiere of _Two Corners_ with Finger Lakes Opera in cooperation with Cincinnati Opera.

In 2023, Ms. Brown made her debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in the world premiere of The Walkers by Daniel Bernard Roumain, sang Wendy Torrance in Paul Moravec's _The Shining_, first with Opera Parallèle in San Francisco and subsequently with Atlanta Opera as well as Micaëla in _Carmen_ with Indianapolis Opera.

In 2022, she resumed performances in the lead role of Esther in Ricky Ian Gordon's opera _Intimate Apparel_ with Lincoln Center Theater (as part of the joint Metropolitan Opera's New Works Program), for which she won several awards, including the World Theater Award for "Outstanding Debut Performance in an Off-Broadway Production". _Intimate Apparel_ is featured on PBS' _Great Performances_ series.

Other career highlights of her recent past were Musetta and Bess, both with New Orleans Opera, Dorothy Jean Hamer in Chandler Carter's _This Little Light of Mine_ with Santa Fe Opera as well as Clara in Jake Heggie's _It's a Wonderful Life_ with San Francisco Opera, where she also covered Dame Shirley in John Adams' _Girls of the Golden West_.

Ms. Brown has performed her signature role Bess with numerous companies such as Utah Festival Opera, Opera Kazan, Skylight Music Theatre, Dayton Opera, Virginia Opera, and the Belarusian Philharmonic Orchestra Minsk. In addition, the European _Porgy and Bess_ tour of the New York Harlem Productions brought her Bess to such prestigious venues as the Staatsoper Hamburg, the Semperoper Dresden, the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, and the Komische Oper Berlin. Another important touring production of the Gershwin classic was with Cape Town Opera, where she premiered the role in 2009 and subsequently went on tour to the Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Festival Hall London, and the Israeli Opera.
