Héloïse Werner is a performer particularly interested in music as drama and music for the stage, experimenting with different genres and techniques.

Héloïse is singer and co-director for award-wining contemporary quartet [The Hermes Experiment](http://www.thehermesexperiment.com/) (clarinet, soprano voice, harp and double bass), winners of the Tunnell Trust Awards 2016, Park Lane Group Young Artists 2015-16, UK Young Artists 2014 and winners of Nonclassical’s Battle of the Bands 2014. The ensemble regularly commissions new works as well as creating their own innovative arrangements and venturing into live free improvisation. The group also strives to create a platform for cross-disciplinary collaboration: in June 2015, they created a ‘musical exhibition’ with photographer [Thurstan Redding](http://www.thurstanredding.com/), and in September 2016, they developed a new interpretation of Shakespeare’s *The Winter’s Tale* during an [Aldeburgh Music Residency](http://www.aldeburgh.co.uk/residencies/current-future-projects). Reducing the play to an hour’s duration in collaboration with director [Nina Brazier](http://www.ninabrazier.co.uk/), composer [Kim Ashton](https://kimbashton.wordpress.com/) & five actors, The Hermes Experiment become part of the drama alongside a wonderful group of actors. The show will première in London this winter, and is supported by Arts Council England, the RVW Trust, Britten-Pears Foundation and Hinrichsen Foundation. Recent praise for The Hermes Experiment: “The performance was meticulously nuanced, witty and chic.” The Times // “This clever mix of instruments is more versatile than you might first think” The Observer // “The combination of harp, clarinet, voice and double bass is not one you hear every day, but in the right hands it works brilliantly. The Hermes Experiment who sport this line-up have in a short few years commissioned prodigiously for it, opening a whole new expressive world” Evening Standard

Together with composer [Jonathan Woolgar](https://jonathanwoolgar.com/) and director [Emily Burns](http://www.emily-burns.com/), Héloïse is currently working on [*Scenes from the End*](http://heloisewerner.com/scenes-from-the-end-16/), a new one-woman opera about grief which premièred this summer at the Camden & Edinburgh Fringe Festivals, and will run at the Tristan Bates Theatre in December 2016 (“extraordinary” Classic FM, “The 10 hottest tickets in town” Evening Standard, “Exceptional and breathtaking” Mumble, “wholly eye opening” The Metropolist, “wonderfully expressive” Edfringe review, “powerful” Fringe Biscuit, “well-acted, quirky and charming production” London Theatre 1).

Other recent operatic roles have included: Doctor in Maxwell Davies’ *Kommilitonen!* (Welsh National Youth Opera), Anya in *Mannequin*, a new one-woman video opera by Maria Vatenina (Tête à Tête Festival Opera), The Vixen in Janacek’s *The Cunning Little Vixen* (CUOS) and Love in Gluck’s *Orfeo* (CCMS). She also plays Marie–Antoinette in a new punk opera *The Crocodile of Old Kang Pow* by Darren Berry (from Razorlight and the Penguin Cafe) due to open later this year.

In recent years, the band has performed at the National Portrait Gallery, Cecil Sharp House, Green Note in Camden, Ronnie Scott’s jazz club, London Folk Festival, Wilderness Festival, and has released two original EP discs: [*The Coach House Company* (2014) and Maiden Tales (2016)](http://thecoachhousecompany.bandcamp.com/).

This has included producing and musically directing *The Spanish Tragedy* by Thomas Kyd in King’s College Chapel, Cambridge (Marlowe Society), working at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre (in their music department), producing Philip Glass’ *In The Penal Colony* at the Arts Theatre (West End) for [Shadwell Opera](http://www.shadwellopera.co.uk/) and producing, performing with, and writing/arranging the music for acclaimed sketch trio *Minor Delays* at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2014 (Gilded Balloon).
