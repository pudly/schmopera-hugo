British bass, Alastair Miles is one of the UK’s most renowned singers returning regularly to the operatic stages and concert platforms of Europe, the USA and the Far East. His international career was launched in 1986 when he won the Decca Kathleen Ferrier Prize at the Wigmore Hall London. He is recognised for his stylistically wide repertoire, equally at home with music of the Baroque period as he is with the romanticism of Verdi and Wagner.

Highlights of his career include Giorgio *I Puritani* and Raimondo *Lucia di Lammermoor* for the Metropolitan Opera and The Netherlands Opera; Basilio *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* and Giorgio *I Puritani* for San Francisco Opera; Cardinal Brogni *La Juive*, Padre Guardiano  *La Forza del Destino*, Prefetto *Linda di Chamounix*, Zaccaria *Nabucco* and Philippe II *Don Carlos* for the Wiener Staatsoper; Claggart *Billy Budd* for Opera North; Lord Sydney *Il Viaggio a Rheims* at La Scala, Milan; title role Handel *Saul*, Arkel *Pelléas et Melisande*, Creonte in Mayr’s *Medea* in Corinto, Timur *Turandot*, and Zoroastro *Orlando* for the Bayerische Staatsoper; Leporello *Don Giovanni* for De Vlaamse Opera and Opera North; and title role *Le Nozze di Figaro*, Brogni *La Juive*, and Narbal *Les Troyens* for Netherlands Opera.

For English National Opera he has performed the title role in Boito’s *Mefistofele*, Silva *Ernani* and Duke Alfonso *Lucrezia Borgia*; for Welsh National Opera Mephistopheles *Faust*, Fiesco *Simon Boccanegra*, Enrico *Anna Bolena*, and Talbot *Maria Stuarda*; for Opera North Mephistopheles *La Damnation de Faust*, Philip II *Don Carlo*, and his appearances for Glyndebourne Festival Opera include Pogner *Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg*, Commendatore *Don Giovanni*, Fiesco *Simon Boccanegra* and Speaker *Die Zauberflöte*, and for Scottish Opera Arkel *Pelléas et Melisande*. He has also performed Claudio *Agrippina* for Opéra de Dijon  and Opéra de Lille, Daland *Der Fliegende Holländer* for Opéra Royal de Wallonie, Philip II *Don Carlo* for the Deutsche Oper Berlin, and Bertram *Robert le Diable* and Nourabad *Les Pêcheurs de Perles* for the Salerno Festival.

Recent projects have included *La Damnation de Faust*, *Dream of Gerontius* and *Messiah* with Sir Colin Davis and London Symphony Orchestra, Schumann *Faustszenen* with Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and with Daniel Harding and the London Symphony and Gewandhaus Orchestras; Beethoven 9th Symphony with Michael Tilson Thomas and San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, *St. Matthew Passion* with the Dallas Symphony, and Sarastro *Die Zauberflöte* with Daniel Harding at the Lucerne Festival, *Elijah* at the Royal Festival Hall with Masur and the LPO, Beethoven 9th Symphony with Wiener Symphoniker, Schubert Mass No. 6 with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and Jonathan Nott, and Osmin *Die Entführung aus dem Serail* on tour with the Orchestra of the Age of Englightenment and Labadie and *Judas Maccabeus* at the BBC Promenade Concerts.
