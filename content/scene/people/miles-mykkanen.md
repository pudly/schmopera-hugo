Miles Mykkanen has garnered recognition on the world's concert and operatic stages for his "focused, full-voiced tenor" (The New York Times).  Of his performances in *Eugene Onegin* at the Juilliard School, Opera News wrote, "Mykkanen was a knockout as Lensky. The lyric intensity of his singing made each moment count, and the duel- scene aria was a stretch of sheer vocal gold.”

The 2017-18 season sees Mr. Mykkanen performing the title role of Bernstein’s *Candide* with the Arizona Opera and Palm Beach Opera and Peter Quint in Britten’s *The Turn of the Screw* for Opera Columbus in a new production by Stephen Wadsworth.  The music of Stravinsky serves the tenor’s debut at the Canadian Opera Company in Robert Lepage’s *The Nightingale and Other Short Fables*.  On the concert stage he is heard in performances of Handel’s *Messiah* with the New Jersey Symphony and Indianapolis Symphony, in concert performances of Verdi’s *Otello* with Robert Spano leading the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and in Bernstein’s *Songfest* with his frequent collaborators, Steven Blier, Michael Barrett, and the New York Festival of Song.  The tenor makes his New York Philharmonic debut in a program of highlights from *West Side Story* conducted by Leonard Slatkin and joins the Bard Music Festival for performances of Moniuszko’s *Halka* and Berlioz’s *Roméo et Juliette* with Leon Botstein conducting the American Symphony Orchestra.

Last season Miles Mykkanen sang Belmonte in Opera Columbus' new production of Mozart’s *Die Entführung aus dem Serail*, Tichon in Janáček’s *Káťa Kabanová* in a new Stephen Wadsworth production at Juilliard conducted by Anne Manson, *Candide* in a fully staged production with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, and joined the world premiere cast of *Kept: A Ghost Story* by Kristin Kuster and Megan Levad in a presentation at the Virginia Arts Festival conducted by JoAnn Falletta.  On the concert stage he bowed in Handel’s *Messiah* with the St. Thomas Church 5th Avenue Choir of Men and Boys and Concert Royal, Mozart’s *Requiem* with the Sarasota Orchestra, and in recital programs under the auspices of the New York Festival of Song.  The tenor spent the summer at the Marlboro Music Festival where his performances spanned from song of Brahms and Britten to chamber music of Brett Dean with distinguished guest artists Paul Lewis, Mitsuko Uchida, Roger Vignoles, and many others.

Mr. Mykkanen's opera credits include championing new work in addition to leading roles drawn from the classic repertoire.  He gave the world premiere of Matthew Aucoin's *Crossing* at the American Repertory Theatre directed by Diane Paulus and Opera News wrote, "Miles Mykkanen’s work was especially distinctive: his burnished high tenor seemed like the organizing principle around which the other voices cohered."  He was involved in the world premieres of Ricky Ian Gordon's *Twenty-Seven* and Jack Perla's *Shalimar the Clown*.  Other operatic highlights include performances of *Die Zauberflöte*, *Eugene Onegin*, *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, *Ariadne auf Naxos*, *Les mamelles de Tirésias*, *La traviata*, *Le nozze di Figaro*, *La finta giardiniera*, *Der Kaiser von Atlantis*, *The Cunning Little Vixen*, *Dialogues of the Carmelites*, *Le donne curiose*, *A Hand of Bridge*, and *Down in the Valley*.  The tenor has sung with Wolf Trap Opera Company and Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, in recital at Carnegie Hall and Alice Tully Hall,  and in concert with Juilliard415, the National Symphony Orchestra, New World Symphony, Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, Mostly Mozart Festival, and with members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

PBS Great Performances produced a documentary of Renée Fleming's American Voices festival in 2015, featuring Miles Mykkanen in a master class with Tony Award-winner Sutton Foster.  He also was seen on Medici.tv in Juilliard’s live-stream master classes with Renée Fleming, Fabio Luisi, and Emmanuel Villaume, respectively.  The tenor is a youngARTS Gold winner, alumnus of The Interlochen Arts Academy, and the recipient of prizes from the Sullivan Foundation, Toulmin Foundation, Novick Career Advancement Grant, and Juilliard’s Joseph W. Polisi Award.  Recently graduated from The Juilliard School with an Artist Diploma in Opera Studies, Miles Mykkanen earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree from the school under the tutelage of Cynthia Hoffmann.
