	A recent national champion, Toronto native Charles Sy received both First prize and Audience Choice in the Canadian Opera Company's 2014 Centre Stage Ensemble Studio Competition Gala. He has been recognized locally and nationally as a promising young artist with a "softly lyric sound, a natural sense of phrasing coupled with a rare willingness to project beyond the apron" (<em>National Post</em>). He is described as "vocally and dramatically mature with a delicious dark tenor sound that [stretches] easily into shining high notes" (<em>Schmopera</em>). Currently completing his MMus in Opera Performance, Charles studies with Dr. Darryl Edwards at the University of Toronto where he also completed his BMus in Voice performance in 2013.

Charles appears as a featured soloist in <em>Serenades: Forgotten and Found</em> with Recitals at Rosedale and in an evening of Gilbert and Sullivan classics with the Ottawa Choral Society. This season also includes the tenor soloist in Handel's <em>Messiah </em>with Choral Connection and with Chorus Niagara, under the direction of Robert Cooper. Charles is thrilled to be an incoming member of the Gerdine Young Artist Program at Opera Theatre of St. Louis for 2015 where he will sing the role of Adolfo and cover the role of Prunier in Puccini's <em>La Rondine.</em>

Previous opera roles include Mayor Upfold in <em>Albert Herring</em> (UofT Opera), Vogelsang in <em>Der Schauspieldirektor</em> (UofT Opera), Alamão in<em>Pedro Malazarte (</em>UofT Opera), Don Ottavio in <em>Don Giovanni </em>and Remendado in<em>Carmen. </em>In 2012, Charles understudied the title role in UofT Opera's renowned <em>Rob Ford: The Opera</em>.
