While in his residency, Jared has reached international attention by participating in some of the world's most renowned vocal competitions.  He was an Encouragement Award winner at the 2016 George London Foundation Vocal Competition, a Fifth Prize winner at the 2016 Licia-Albanese Puccini Foundation International Vocal Competition, a Finalist in the 2015 International Hans Gabor Belvedere Singing Competition held at the Dutch National Opera, a Fifth Prize winner at the 2015 Giulio Gari Foundation International Vocal Competition, nominated for a 2015 and 2016 Sarah Tucker Study Grant by the Richard Tucker Music Foundation, a Fourth Prize winner at the 2015 Loren L.

In addition to such prestigious venues as the Metropolitan Opera and Dutch National Opera, Jared has made concert appearances as a soloist at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra under the direction of maestro Yu Long. 

In October of 2016 Jared opened the George London Foundation Recital Series with mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard at the Morgan Library & Museum.  Most recently, Jared made his debut with the Voices of Ascension Chorus and Orchestra at The Church of the Ascension for their annual Candlelight Christmas Concerts.

Before his residency at the Academy, Jared was an apprentice singer with The Santa Fe Opera during the 2013 festival season where he performed the role of Baron Grog (_La Grande-Duchesse De Gerolstein_) alongside Susan Graham and covered the roles of Colonel Isaacson and Justice Wills in the world premiere of _Oscar_ and the title role in _Le Nozze Di Figaro_.  In 2016, Jared returned to the Santa Fe Opera for a second apprenticeship to perform the role of Bello (_La Fanciulla del West_) featuring Patricia Racette and cover the roles of Olivier (_Capriccio_) and Don Giovanni.  

Jared received a Bachelor's Degree in Economics from the University of Utah in 2010, where he also completed a Music Minor and a full pre-medical curriculum.  After receiving his degree, Jared shifted his focus from medicine to voice and performed his first role as John Brooke in Mark Adamo's _Little Women_ with the University of Utah Lyric Opera Ensemble.  He also covered the title role of Don Giovanni with the Lyric Opera Ensemble and made his company debut with Utah Opera as the Second Prisoner (_Fidelio_) and the Usher (_Rigoletto_).

Looking to the future, Jared will return to the Santa Fe Opera this summer to cover the title role of Steve Jobs in the world premiere of _The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs_, and will make his professional debut with the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona as Lescaut (_Manon Lescaut_) in June of 2018 and with Arizona Opera as Figaro (_Il Barbiere di Siviglia_) in March of 2018.
