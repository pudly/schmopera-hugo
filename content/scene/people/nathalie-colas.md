She made a critically acclaimed stage debut as Despina in Mozart’s *Cosi fan Tutte* at Theater Biel Solothurn, Switzerland. She sang Julia in Boris Blacher’s *Romeo und Julia*, Serpina in Anfossi’s *Il curioso indiscreto*, Rosina in Paisiello’s *Il Barbiere di Siviglia* (Opéra de Chambre de Genève), Alceste in Myslivecek’s *Antigona* (Biel, Szeged), Eugenia (*Der Geizhals*), Rita (*Rita*), Vespetta (*Pimpinone*), Quiteria (*Don Quichotte*), Amaryllis (*Dido and Aeneas*), Clorinda (*Il Signor Fagotto*).

A fervent chamber music musician, Nathalie is a founding member of new music ensemble Fonema Consort, of LiederStube, an oasis for art song in the city, and a regular soloist with Voix de Stras | Choeur de Chambre de Strasbourg. In 2015, Ms. Colas created Petite Musique Collective which produces concerts that seek to erase the gap between poetry, music, and visual arts while highlighting the immense number of artistic talents that call Chicago their home.
In demand as a concert soloist, Nathalie sang Bach’s *Trauerode* with the Brussels Baroque Ensemble, F.X. Richter’s Mass in C, Gounod’s *Messe Solennelle*, the Dvorak *Requiem*, and Schubert Mass in B in Switzerland; she was featured in Haydn’s *Lord Nelson Mass* (St Louis), in Handel's Messiah (MO, France), with the Park Ridge Orchestra under Maestro James Setapen, and is a current soloist with the Chicago Bach Ensemble (dir. Rubén Dubrovsky).

Born in Strasbourg and raised in the Alsatian vineyards, Nathalie is a graduate from DePaul University School of Music, holds a MA in Classical singing and baroque Chamber Music from the Brussels Royal Flemish Conservatory and a professional degree in Opera from the Swiss Opera Studio/Hochschule der Künste Bern. She studied Art Song with the late german Baritone Udo Reinemann.
