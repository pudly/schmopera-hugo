Praised for "a ripe, sensual lyric soprano"(Opera News) and a "captivating combination of skilled singing and magnetic acting" (Pioneer Press), soprano Tess Altiveros is equally at home in a vast range of repertoire from the 17th century to the 21st, making her highly sought after for a wide array of concert and operatic work alike.  Her recent portrayal of E in Seattle Opera's acclaimed _O+E_ “stole the show” according to The Stranger, while her Euridice/Proserpina in the West Coast tour of Monteverdi's _L'Orfeo_ under Grammy winning conductor, Stephen Stubbs was described by Vancouver Classical Music as“an artful combination of facial expression, gesture, and vocal suavity...infusing both characters with tenderness and charm as well as dignity.”

Other roles include Clorinda in Seattle Opera's _The Combat_, Hannah in _The Merry Widow_ (Inland Northwest Opera), Pamina in _Die Zauberflöte_ (Pacific Symphony), Maria in _West Side Story_ (Central City Opera/Boulder Philharmonic), Bach _St. Matthew Passion_ (Colorado Symphony, staged), Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_ (Skylark Opera Theatre), Musetta in _La Bohème_ under the baton of Mo. Andrew Litton (Colorado Symphony), Carmen in _La Tragédie de Carmen_ (Skylark Opera Theatre), Susanna in _The Marriage of Figaro_ (Angels & Demons Entertainment), Miss Jessel in _Turn of the Screw_ (Eugene Opera) and leading ladies with Vespertine Opera Theater (_Les Mamelles de Tirésias_, _La Voix Humaine_, _La Bohème_).  

Recent season concert work includes Missions and Mysteries with Stephen Stubbs at the Berkeley Festival and Exhibition, Mass for the Oppressed (Anchorage Concert Chorus), Rossini’s _Messe Solonelle_ (South Bend Chamber Singers), Vaughan Williams _Dona Nobis Pacem_ (Seattle Pro Musica, Philharmonia Northwest), and Handel’s _Messiah_ (Symphony Tacoma, Bremerton Symphony, Great Bend Center for Music).  Tess also has the privilege of singing a number of world premieres this season, including Emerson Eads’s _Princess Sophia_ (The Orpheus Project) Donald Skirvin’s _Canticles of Crimson_, and will make her Carnegie Hall debut in the premiere of John Muehleisen’s _Borders_ in May of 2019.

Upcoming engagements include Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ (Kentucky Opera),  Fiordiligi in _Così fan Tutte_ (Skylark Opera Theatre), L'enfant in _L'Enfant et les Sortilèges_ (Pacific Symphony), Dalila in Handel’s _Samson_ (Pacific MusicWorks), The Creation (Philharmonia Northwest) and her role reprisal in Robert Neu’s fully staged _St Matthew Passion_ (Shreveport Symphony Orchestra).

A native Seattleite, Miss Altiveros has been a regular anthem singer for the Seattle Mariners for over a decade, and holds a Master’s degree in vocal performance from the University of Washington.
