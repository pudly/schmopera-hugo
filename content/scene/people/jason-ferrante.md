Opera News praises tenor Jason Ferrante for “singing up a stylish storm” and for getting “the gold star for trills” and the Berkshire Eagle says he “seems to brighten every stage he mounts.” 

In the 2017-2018 season, Ferrante creates the role of Little Victor Farrell in the world premiere of Kevin Puts and Mark Campbell’s *Elizabeth Cree* with Opera Philadelphia to open their O17 Festival. He’ll repeat Little Victor for his debut with Chicago Opera Theater, then debut with Nashville Opera as Little Bat in *Susannah* and at Intermountain Opera as Bardolfo in *Falstaff*. Ferrante also returns to the Jacksonville Symphony as the tenor soloist in Handel’s *Messiah*. Last season, Ferrante debuted with Opera Philadelphia as Don Basilio/Don Curzio in *Le Nozze di Figaro* in a production filmed for HD telecast in Philadelphia’s “Opera on the Mall” presentation as part of their O17 festival and as Goro in *Madama Butterfly* with Arizona Opera. 

On the international stage, Ferrante made his European debut at Teatro Comunale di Bologna as Beadle Bamford in *Sweeney Todd*. The production also appeared at Teatro Pavarotti in Modena, Teatro Rossini in Lugo, and Teatro Municipale in Piacenza. He was the Tenor Ghost in Corigliano’s *The Ghosts Of Versailles* with the Wexford Festival, and sang Pong in *Turandot* under the baton of Lorin Maazel in the grand opening of the Zaha Hadid-designed opera house in Guangzhou, China.

Ferrante is quickly becoming a sought-out voice teacher. His students sing around the world with opera companies including the Met, Covent Garden, English National Opera, Santa Fe, San Francisco, Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Glimmerglass, and Wolf Trap. He currently serves as a vocal consultant to the young artists programs at Wolf Trap Opera, Arizona Opera, Nashville Opera, and Pensacola Opera and is on the faculty of the UBC Summer Vocal Workshop in Vancouver, BC. He is a national panelist and master teacher for YoungArts, the core program of the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, which recognizes and supports America's most talented high school artists in the visual, literary, and performing arts and includes nominating future Presidential Scholars in the Arts.

Ferrante holds both Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees from The Juilliard School where he held the Alice Tully Voice Scholarship and his professional training includes two summers at Wolf Trap where he was a two-time recipient of a Shouse Grant, three summers at the Aspen Music Festival, and two summers at Tanglewood.
