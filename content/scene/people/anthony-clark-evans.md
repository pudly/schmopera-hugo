Rising American baritone Anthony Clark Evans makes major debuts in the 2016-2017
season, firstly as Sharpless in *Madama Butterfly* with the San Francisco Opera. Later in the season, he makes his Metropolitan Opera debut as the Huntsman in *Rusalka* while
also covering Riccardo in *I Puritani*. Last season, Mr. Evans made debuts with San
Diego Opera as Sharpless in *Madama Butterfly* and with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as
Marcello in *La bohème*. He returned to Lyric Opera of Chicago to create the role of
Simon Thibault in the world premiere of *Bel Canto*, adapted from Ann Patchett’s
bestselling novel into an opera by composer Jimmy Lopez and Pulitzer Prize-winning
playwright, Nilo Cruz.

Mr. Evans recently completed a two-year tenure at Lyric Opera of Chicago’s prestigious
Ryan Opera Center, where he has been heard as Montano in *Otello* for his debut with the
company, Yamadori (Sharpless cover) in *Madama Butterfly*, the Jailer in *Tosca* (while
covering the Sacristan), the Servant in *Capriccio* (while covering the Count), the Hunter (Gamekeeper cover) in *Rusalka*, Commissario (Baron and Marquis cover) in *La traviata*, and covers of Leporello in *Don Giovanni*, Wolfram in *Tannhäuser*, and Fiorello in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*. Recent concert engagements include Faure’s *Requiem* with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra and his Ravinia Festival debut singing in Bernstein’s *Songfest* with Ensemble dal Niente. In the summer of 2014, he performed Leporello in *Don Giovanni* in the Ryan Opera Center’s Workshop, as well as sang the Theatre Director in *Les mamelles de Tirésias* with the Chicago Civic Orchestra.

In 2012, Mr. Evans was thrust onto the international operatic scene as a Grand Finals
Winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. Prior to this, he was
working as a car salesman in Kentucky. The Met Auditions were only the first of a
lengthy list of awards granted this gifted baritone: the following year, he received top
prize in the Lissner, Albanese-Puccini, Giulio Gari, and Mario Lanza vocal competitions,
as well as second prize in the Liederkranz and Opera Index competitions. His success
continued in 2014 with awards from the Sullivan Foundation, the Luminarts Fellowship,
and the American Opera Society, as well as a Sara Tucker Study Grant.

Anthony Clark Evans studied voice at Murray State University, where he portrayed Sir
John Falstaff in *Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor* and was involved in various
ensembles. He was an apprentice artist with Opera in the Ozarks (Arkansas) in 2008 and
was featured there as Marcello in *La bohème* and Pish-Tush in *The Mikado*. Mr. Evans
resides in Elizaebthtown, Kentucky with his wife, Kim, and daughter, Bryn.
