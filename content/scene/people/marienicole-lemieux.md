It is no wonder that Marie-Nicole Lemieux shines today in the world of singing: the singer like the woman radiates an aura that belongs only to the greatest.

Her vocal talents were revealed to the public in 2000 when she won the Queen Fabiola and Lied Prize at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.

The beginning of her career is marked by baroque music (*Orphée* by Gluck, *Giulio Cesare*, *Ariodante*, *Orlando Furioso*, *Salomon*, *Theodora*…).
