Praised for her “…ardor and warmth…” by the Houston Press, soprano Théodora Cottarel has been recognized for her vocal versatility and her electric dramatic interpretations. Of her performance as Servilia in _La Clemenza di Tito_, Broadway World wrote: “Armed with confidence and purity of tone, Cottarel’s wielded power lends to her delicateness. Her singing is thoroughly enjoyable and the expression of solid warmth is neatly articulated through her emotions.” Théodora has been singing internationally in both operas and concerts.

She had her first successes as Pamina (_Die Zauberflöte_) and Gretel (_Hansel and Gretel_) in New York; and triumphed as Fiordiligi (_Cosí fan tutte_), the Angel (_Jarireh_, a Persian opera) and Micaëla (_Carmen_), Cendrillon (_Cendrillon_) in Boston; and Elvira (_Don Giovanni_) and Servilia (_La Clemenza di Tito_) in Houston. In Europe, she sang Arminda (_La Finta Giardinera_), Adina (_L’elisir d’amore_), Manon (_Manon_) and Norina (_Don Pasquale_) in France; Despina (_Così fan tutte_) in Italy; and Polly (_Beggar’s Opera_) and Shadow Jo (_Little Women_ –EU Premier) in Belgium.  Other roles include: Suor Genovieffa (_Suor Angelica_) and Maria (Edward Poll’s _Yerma_– world premier) in the United States. In 2020, she covered the role of Matilde with Odyssey Opera and will sing the role of Madame Goldentrill (_The Impresario_).

Passionate about acting, Théodora has had the privilege of working with the late Elizabeth Kemp and interned under her at the Actor’s Studio. She has also trained with director Claudine Hunault in France. She will perform in her first play as The Wife in Garcia Lorca’s _The Blood Wedding_ this year presented at the Boston Playwright’s Theater.

In concert, notably, Théodora has sung at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées where she had the honor of performing with Lambert Wilson and Jay Gottlieb, and alongside artistic giants such as Menahem Pressler, Ivry Gitlis, and Charlotte Rampling. Other concerts include: Britten’s _Ceremony of Carols_ in the United States, Do Disturb Festival in Gabrielle Goliath’s _Elegy_ and Tiziana De Carolis’ _Dualités Déconcertante_ in France, and in Mozart’s _Missa Brevis in Do_ or Mozart’s _Vesperae Solennes_ with the Rome Philharmonic.

An avid chamber music performer, Théodora continually gives recitals in France, Italy and The United States, in various venues such as Le Festival Présences Féminines and MIT’s Killian Hall. Passionate about performing work by female composers Théodora has performed in the original recital “Voies(x) de Femmes” eleven times with pianist and composer Tiziana De Carolis throughout 2019 and 2020. A CD of the program will be released in 2020 with the label Digressione Music. She will also perform new work “Aubades” in composer Felix Jarrar’s showcase. Born in the United States to French parents, Théodora received her Bachelor’s of Music from the Manhattan School of Music.
