Soprano Jessica Jane Jacobs has been praised by critics for her "warm", "clear", and "bejeweled" vocal tone along with her "affecting", "strong", and "honest" stage presence. Ms. Jacobs is becoming noticed for her abilities as a singing actress. Of her performance as Mimì in _La Bohème_ one reviewer wrote, "Jacobs’s ability to respond organically to her cast mates puts her in a growing minority of opera singers who are able to fully integrate dramatic truthfulness with fine vocal delivery." (_The Boston Musical Intelligencer_)

In the 2015-16 season, Ms. Jacobs sings Marguerite in Boston Opera Collaborative’s reinterpretation of Gounod’s _Faust_. In the 2014-15 season, she performed Armida in Handel’s _Rinaldo_ with Boston Opera Collaborative and Mimì in _La Bohème_ with NEMPAC Opera Project. Other recent highlights include Rosalinde in _Die Fledermaus_ with NEMPAC Opera Project, Miss Wordsworth in Britten’s _Albert Herring_ with Boston Opera Collaborative, Miss Ellen in _Lakmé_ with Lowell House Opera, Second Woman in _Dido and Aeneas_ with Harvard Early Music Society, Violetta cover in _La Traviata_ with FOPAC Opera, and Anna in _The King and I_ with Calliope Productions.

Ms. Jacobs has spent two summers in Lucca, Italy with the Opera Theater and Music Festival of Lucca, where she performed the roles of Barbarina in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and Norina in _Don Pasquale_. She returned to Italy in the summer of 2010 as a member of “i Solisiti di Spoleto" at CCM Spoleto’s inaugural season, where she performed scenes from _Don Giovanni_ and _Roméo et Juliette_ with full orchestra in the historic Teatro Nuovo. In the summers of 2012 and 2013, Ms. Jacobs sang with Sugar Creek Opera as an Apprentice Artist, singing the roles of Nella in _Gianni Schicchi_ and covering the role of Love Simpson in Carlisle Floyd’s _Cold Sassy Tree_.

Ms. Jacobs has received an encouragement award from the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (Southeast Ohio District 2009). She placed second in the Just Love to Sing! Competition in NH (2012) and has been chosen as a semi-finalist in the Peter Elvins Competition (2012 and 2016), The 2016 Orpheus Vocal Competition, and Opera Theater Pittsburgh’s 2015 Mildred Miller International Voice Competition. 

A graduate of Northwestern University (Bachelors of Music) and the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music (Masters of Music and Artist Diploma), Ms. Jacobs has worked under the tutelage of many excellent musicians. At Northwestern, Ms. Jacobs’ operatic performance highlights included Esmeralda in _The Bartered Bride_ and covering the role of Cecchina in Piccini’s opera _La Cecchina_. At CCM, she sang Lady with a Cake Box in Argento's _Postcard from Morocco_, Adele in Johann Strauss’ _Die Fledermaus_, Alexis in Offenbach’s rarely performed gem _L’île de Tulipatan_, and a full role study of Juliette in Gounod's _Roméo et Juliette_.

Ms. Jacobs is equally comfortable on the concert stage. At Northwestern, she was chosen as one of the three vocalists for the performance of John Adams’ _Grand Pianola Music_, where the voices sit among the instruments and sing pitches on vowels only, as members of the wind ensemble. She also participated in a reading of Eric Whitacre’s opera _Paradise Lost_ and as a soloist with the Northwestern Chamber Choir in works by Bach and Handel. Ms. Jacobs recently performed as soprano soloist in Honegger's _King David_ with The Master Singers of Worcester. She has performed works such as Vivaldi’s _Gloria_, Faure’s _Requiem_, and Handel’s _Messiah_ in concert.

Ms. Jacobs currently lives in Boston, Massachusetts with her husband, Michael Tybursky, a trombonist, and their son Benjamin. She currently studies with Dr. Rebecca Folsom.
