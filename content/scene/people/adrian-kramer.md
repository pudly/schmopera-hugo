Canadian tenor Adrian Kramer has joined opera companies throughout North America in recent seasons, earning critical praise for his vocal appeal and his strong theatrical engagement. In 2018 he makes his Edmonton Opera debut as Ralph Rackstraw in *HMS Pinafore* and his off-Broadway debut in collaboration with Ensemble of the Romantic Century as the Tenor in *Tchaikovsky: None But the Lonely Heart*, as well as joining Opera Philadelphia as Normanno in *Lucia di Lammermoor*.  Mr. Kramer will then return to Opera Omaha as Gérard in Philip Glass's *Les Enfants Terribles* as part of their acclaimed ONE Festival.  He made an especially successful San Diego Opera debut in 2017 as Don José in *La tragédie de Carmen*. 

Additional recent operatic commitments include performances with Opera Omaha, as Bill in Jonathan Dove's *Flight* and as Joe in the company premiere of *La fanciulla del West*, and Santa Fe Opera, where he performed Borsa in *Rigoletto*, the Second Nazarene in *Salome*, Owen's Son in the world premiere of Jennifer Higdon's *Cold Mountain*, and the Second Bodyguard in the American premiere of Huang Ruo's *Dr. Sun Yat-sen*. Mr. Kramer has also appeared with Toronto Operetta Theatre as Nanki-Poo in *The Mikado*, Toronto's Opera 5 in a double bill of Offenbach's *Ba-ta-clan* and Hahn's *L'île du rêve*, and Tapestry Opera in their multi-media *Tap: Ex Revolutions*.

A seasoned performer on the concert platform, Mr. Kramer's oratorio and symphonic repertoire includes *Elijah* (Kingston Symphony Orchestra), Vaughan Williams' *Hodie* (Talisker Players), Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (Canzona Chamber Players Orchestra), and *Messiah* (Sault Symphony Orchestra). 

Initially training as a baritone, Ms. Kramer's credits in that repertoire include performances with Chicago Opera Theater, Canadian Opera Company, the Castleton Festival, Cal Performances,  Ravinia's Steans Music Institute, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and Glimmerglass Opera. 

He was awarded the Chalmers Professional Development Grant from the Ontario Arts Council and the Campbell Wachter Memorial Award for Singers from Santa Fe Opera, as well as winning the Louis Quilico Competition (grand prize) and the Juilliard Honors Recital Competition. Mr. Kramer is also a proud six-time grant recipient from the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation. 

Mr. Kramer earned his MM in Opera at the Curtis Institute of Music and his BM in Voice at the Juilliard School.
