Highlights from the 2015-2016 season include singing the roles of Prince Yamadori and the Imperial Commissioner in *Madama Butterfly* with Vancouver Opera and a debut with the Vancouver Bach Choir singing Vox Christus in Bach's *Matthäus-Passion*.

Alan's performances in the 2014-2015 season included Elvis Costello’s *The Juliet Letters* with the Koerner Quartet, Beethoven’s Symphony no 9 with the Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra, Messiah with the Prince George Symphony and the creation of four roles in the world premiere of Shane Koyczan and Neil Weisensel’s *Stickboy* with Vancouver Opera.

An alumnus of UBC (MMus, Opera), other recent performances include the title role in Vancouver Opera in School’s production of *The Barber of Barkerville*, Guglielmo in *Così fan tutte*, a featured performer in the review *Side by Side* by Sondheim and Danillo (*Die Lustige Witwe*) performed with both the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and UBC Opera.
