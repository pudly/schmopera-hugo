Celebrated by Opera News for his "fat, resonant bass" and proclaimed as "a singer to watch" by the Virginia Gazette, bass Eric Lindsey has sung under the direction of conductors Victor DeRenzi, Marcello Cormio, Brent McMunn, Dr. Raymond Harvey, Ward Holmquist, Pacien Mazzagatti, Chris Fecteau, and Jorge Parodi. Recent engagements for Mr. Lindsey include the roles of Sarastro in _The Magic Flute_, the title role in _Don Giovanni_, Nourabad in _The Pearl Fishers_, Dottore Grenvil in _La traviata_, and his Spoleto Festival USA debut as the 5th Jew in Salome. He has also  worked for companies such as Opera in Williamsburg, VA, Lakeland Opera, Opera Shreveport, Sarasota Opera, New York City Opera, and the Metropolitan Opera.

He is extremely excited to make several company debuts in 2023: as a Filene Artist for Wolf Trap Opera in their productions of _Semele_ and _Don Giovanni_ (portraying Cadmus & Somnus and the Commendatore, respectively), for New Amsterdam Opera in the role of Alfonso in _Lucrezia Borgia_, and as Il Sommo Sacerdote in Teatro Gratacielo's American premiere of _La Vestale_.

Mr. Lindsey has been heavily involved in brand new stage works. He debuted the role of King Hjalmar in the world premiere of Princess Maleine, by Whitney George and Bea Goodwin for Dell'Arte Opera Ensemble.

Equally at home in concert form as well as the stage, Mr. Lindsey's upcoming engagements include the Faur√© Requiem as a soloist for Riverside Church in Manhattan, and a soloist in Rossini's _Stabat Mater_ for the Handel Society at the Hopkins Center for the Arts in Hannover, New Hampshire.

Mr. Lindsey resides in Manhattan with his wife, Jenny, and their two children: John and Josephine. He studies with Andrea DelGiudice and is represented by Peter Randsman of Randsman Artist Management.
