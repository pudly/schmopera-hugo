Praised	by the San Francisco Chronicle as an “artist ready for the big time”, soprano Susannah Biller was recently seen as Daisy in the San Francisco premiere of John Harbison's	*The Great Gatsby* with	Ensemble Parallele.	In recent seasons,	she	was a	member	of	the	prestigious	Adler	 Fellowship	 Program	 with	 San	 Francisco	Opera.	While	 in San	 Francisco,	 she	 was	 seen	 as	 Frasquita	 in	 *Carmen*,	 Lolita	 in	 the	 world	 premiere	 of	 John	Harbison's	*Heart	of	a	Soldier*, Kristina	in	*The	Makropoulos	Case* and	 Madame	 Herz	 in	 *Der	 Schauspieldirektor*.	 Additional	 productions	 with	 San	 Francisco Opera include	 *Der	 Ring	 des	 Nibelungen*, *Serse* and*Werther*.

Last season,	 she	 joined Beth	 Morrison	 Projects	 as	 the	 title	 role	 in	 *Madame	White	Snake*,	San	Diego	Opera	as	Clorinda	in	*La	Cenerentola*,	 Minnesota	 Opera	 as	 Kitty	 Packard	 in	 the	 world	 premiere	 of	*Dinner	 at	
Eight*,	 and	 returned to	 Opera	 Theatre	 of	 St.	 Louis	 as	 Fraulein Burstner/Leni	 in	 *The	 Trial*	 by	 Philip	 Glass. The	 2017-2018	 season	 and	beyond includes Norina	 in	 *Don	 Pasquale*	 with	 Minnesota	 Opera,	Lieschen	 in	*Der Ring des	 Polykrates* with	 The	 Dallas	Opera,	 Nanetta	 in	*Falstaff*	with Opera	Colorado,	and	her	Austin	Opera	debut.

The 2015-2016	 season included Ms.	 Biller’s debut	 with	the	 Louisiana	 Philharmonic	 for	 Mahler’s	 2nd Symphony,	 her	 return	to	Arizona	Opera	as	Rosalba	in	*Florencia	en	el	Amazonas*, and debuts with	Lyric	Opera	of	Kansas	City	as	Adina	in	*L’elisir	d’amore*,	Des	Moines	Metro	Opera	as	*Eurydice	in	Orphée*	et Eurydice,	and	 the	Knoxville	Symphony	Orchestra. 

The	2014-2015	season	saw	Ms.	Biller	as	Adele	in	*Die	Fledermaus* with	Portland	Opera	Mica	in	Carly	Simon’s	*Romulus	 Hunt* with	Nashville	Opera,	Marie	in	La	fille	du	régiment	with	Arizona	Opera	and	Costanza	in	Riccardo	Primo	with	Opera	 Theater	of	St.	Louis.	To	open	 the	2013-2014	season,	Ms.	Biller	portrayed	 the	 role	of	Selena	in	 the	world	premiere	of	*Dolores	Claiborne* with	San	Francisco	Opera.	She	received	multiple	accolades	for	her	work	in	this	role	including	from	the	 San	 Francisco	 Chronicle,	 which	 hailed	 that	 she	 “was	 a	 bright	 toned,	 poignant	 Selena;	 her	 aria	 during	 the	 eclipse	 garnered	a	well-earned	explosion	of	applause”	and Opera	Now,	who	acclaimed	that	she	“was	hugely	impressive	as	the	abused	daughter.	Her	crystalline	soprano	and	limpid	tonal	production	perfectly	suggested	the	young	woman,	but	then	assumed	 a	 hint	 of	 steel	 when	 she	 matures	 into	 the	 bitter	 twenty-something	 who	 hates	 her	 mother.”	 Additional	engagements	 for	 the	2013-2014	season	included	Garcias	in	*Don	Quichotte*	with	San	Diego	Opera	and	Adina	in	*L’elisir	d’amore*	with	Opera	Theater	of	St.	Louis.

In	the	2011-2012	season,	Ms.	Biller	made	her	New	York	Debut	as	Fortuna	in	Christopher	Alden's	new	production	of	*Il	sogno	di	scipione* with	Gotham	Chamber	Opera	and returned	to	San	Francisco	Opera	forproductions	of	*Nixon	in	China* and	*Die	Zauberflöte*.
