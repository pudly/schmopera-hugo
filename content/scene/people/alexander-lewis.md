With worldwide operatic engagements and acclaimed performances in musical theatre, Australian tenor Alexander Lewis is forging a unique career as a “cross-over” artist. He performed the role of John Wormley in the world première of Matthew Aucoin’s opera *Crossing*, inspired by Walt Whitman's journals. Of his performance as the wounded young soldier, *The New York Times* hailed “The affecting young tenor Alexander Lewis brings cagey intensity to the role, singing by turns with flashes of defiance and pleading despair.” This season’s engagements include reprisals of Count Danilo in *The Merry Widow* with West Australian Opera and Opera Australia, John Wormley in a remounting of *Crossing* at Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the title role of *The Nose* with Opera Australia and the Komische Oper Berlin.

Last season saw Mr. Lewis as Hoffmann in *Les contes d’Hoffmann* and Grisko in *The Fair at Sorochyntsi* in a return to Komische Oper Berlin, the title role in *The Nose* in his début with The Royal Opera House Covent Garden, the role of Count Danilo in *The Merry Widow* with West Australian Opera, and in a Christmas concert with Sydney Philharmonia. Additional recent opera engagements include the title role in *Les contes d’Hoffmann* in his European début at Komische Oper Berlin; multiple engagements with The Metropolitan Opera including the title role of *The Nose*, St. Brioche in *The Merry Widow*, Borsa in their contemporary production of *Rigoletto*, and productions of *The Death of Klinghoffer* and *Die Fledermaus*; his Washington National Opera début as Flask in *Moby Dick*; and Tamino in *Die Zauberflöte* with West Australian Opera

He completed The Metropolitan Opera’s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, where highlights of his time there included Ferrando in The Met-Juilliard production of *Così fan tutte*, conducted by Alan Gilbert, and Vašek in The Met-Juilliard production of *The Bartered Bride* under the baton of Maestro James Levine.

He was praised for his performance as George in Sondheim’s *Sunday in the Park with George* for the Victorian Opera Company in Melbourne. “Alexander Lewis as the artist Georges Seurat brings a humanity, vulnerability and anguish to the role, as well as a flawless operatic tenor voice.” (TheatrePress Australia) Other musical appearances have included Anthony Hope in *Sweeney Todd* with Opera Australia, Frederick Barret in *Titanic* with Seabiscuit Productions, and Raoul and The Phantom in *The Phantom of the Opera* with The Really Useful Group.

In recent concert engagements, he sang the tenor solo in Dvořák’s *Stabat Mater* with Omaha Symphony, the role of Gerhard in H. K. Gruber’s *Gloria: A Pig Tale* in The New York Philharmonic’s inaugural Biennial Festival, and a series of recitals and concerts throughout Australia. Additional concert highlights include *The Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings* at The Bangalow Music Festival, the *Petite messe solenelle* with The Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, The Met’s Summer Recital series, the Manchester Music Festival, and the role of Poisson in The Opera Orchestra of New York’s performance of *Adriana Lecouvreur* at Carnegie Hall.

He is a graduate of The Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts’s acclaimed Music Theatre Program and the Merola Opera Program in San Francisco where he performed Nemorino in *L’elisir d’amore*.
