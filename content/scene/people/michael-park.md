Michael Park is a composer and pianist with a keen interest in speech, humour, and collaboration. His music aims to give audiences an experience beyond the realm of traditional concert-going.

Heralded for his innovative projects, his Ted Talk *Experiencing Disease Through Music* has been described as moving, haunting, and an amazing translation of the disease. In 2013, his opera, *Diagnosis: Diabetes* was awarded the Gold Medal and BMO Advocacy Award, by the Boston Metro Opera’s International Composer’s Competition.

An accomplished pianist, Michael’s experiences with improvisation and multi-disciplinary collaboration led him to studies in composition. He is a founder and co-director of Art Song Lab, an innovative program that teams composers with poets. He also sits on the board of directors for Vancouver’s Redshift Music Society.
