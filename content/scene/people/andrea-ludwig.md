Born and raised in Regina, Saskatchewan, Juno-nominated mezzo soprano Andrea Ludwig is an artist of tremendous depth, musicality and scope. Her charm, warmth and easy sense of humour are perfect for the stage and her vibrant musicality makes her a favourite to all her audiences. Her versatility and ability to interpret many styles are impeccable.

Hailed by Halifax Chronicle Herald critic Stephen Pedersen as having “tones of silver and gold,” Andrea has appeared with the Canadian Opera Company in numerous roles including Nireno in Handel’s *Julius Ceasar*, the Second Niece in Britten’s *Peter Grimes*, Flora in *The Turn of the Screw*, Moira in Paul Ruder’s *The Handmaid’s Tale*, and Liesgen in Bach’s *Coffee Cantata*.

Very much in demand for contemporary opera, Andrea has been involved in many of Tapestry New Opera’s projects including their LibLab and Opera Briefs, as well as the world premiere of Juliet Palmer’s *Shelter* at Edmonton Opera in 2012 and Toronto in June 2014. Andrea was Nada in the multi Dora-nominated Queen of Puddings’ production of Ana Sokolovic’s *Svadba (The Wedding)* that had its world premiere in Toronto in June 2011. She reprised the role of Nada in France, Serbia and Ireland in 2012; at Edmonton Opera and Philadelphia Opera in 2013; and at the prestigious Festival D’Aix en Provence in 2015.

Ms. Ludwig’s commitment to concert performance remains a strong focus. She made her debut with Symphony Nova Scotia in 2011 in R. Murray Schafer’s “Adieu, Robert Schumann” and made a return in 2013 for a tribute concert to Peter Lieberson in which she sang his “Neruda Songs.” More recently, Andrea performed eight orchestrated Schubert lieder with Symphony Nova Scotia, including one newly-arranged by Canada’s own Brian Current. A recording of this concert is currently in production.

This past May, she performed a sumptuous program of Kurt Weill, John Plant and Toronto composer, Monica Pearce with The Talisker Players. Andrea has also performed Gustav Mahler’s “Das Lied von der Erde” with Kindred Spirits Orchestra; Handel’s *Messiah* with Symphony New Brunswick and Toronto’s Against the Grain Theatre; Mozart’s Mass in C Minor with The Amadeus Choir of Toronto and the Regina Philharmonic Chorus; Mozart’s *Requiem* with the Thunder Bay Orchestra; and Beethoven’s 9th with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

Andrea is proud to announce her recent Juno nomination for a recording of Canadian composer Peter Togni’s Responsio in collaboration with Jeff Reilly, Suzie LeBlanc, Charles Daniels and John Potter.
