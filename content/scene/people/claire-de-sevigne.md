Named one of CBC’s Top Young Canadian Classical Musicians, soprano Claire de Sévigné was recently nominated for a Classical Album of the Year JUNO award for her Naxos album of Vivaldi Cantatas with Kevin Mallon and the Aradia Ensemble. Recent successes have come with the Canadian Opera Company, Savonlinna Opera Festival, Opernhaus Zürich and Théâtre des Champs-Élysées as Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail,_ in which she was hailed for her “sparkling top notes and vocal brilliance, lightness and finesse”.

The upcoming 2022/2023 season marks several role and house debuts for de Sévigné, including with Pacific Opera Victoria as the Nachtigall in their new production of Braunfel’s _Die Vögel_, and Opéra national de Montpellier as Erste Dame in Mozart’s _Die Zauberflöte._ To kick off the season, she appears in concert as Henriette in Halévy’s _L'Éclair_ with Grand Théâtre de Genève**.**

During the 20/21 and 21/22 seasons, Ms. de Sévigné was heard as Cunegonde in _Candide_ for Grand Théâtre de Genève, as la Fée in Massenet’s _Cendrillon_ for the Lucerne Festival, as Adele in _Die Fledermaus_ for Angers Nantes Opéra and Opéra d’Avignon, and Solveig in Grieg’s _Peer Gynt_ with Opéra National de Lyon.

In the 2019-20 season, Ms. de Sévigné was a member of the core Ensemble with the Grand Théâtre de Genève singing the roles of Phani in _Les Indes Galantes_, Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail,_ Sacerdotessa in _Aida_, Clorinda in _La Cenerentola_ and L'Ange in _Saint François d'Assise._ Other engagements included the role of Venus in _Le Grand Macabre_ with the Hamburg Elbphilharmonie, a return in the role of Blonde with the Savonlinna Opera Festival in Finland, Mozart concerts with the Salzburg Festival, and Fiakermilli in _Arabella_ with Opernhaus Zürich. Regrettably her appearance with Maestro Kent Nagano in his final performance with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra was cancelled due to the global pandemic.

Recent career highlights for Ms. de Sévigné include performances with the Grant Park Music Festival of Chicago in _Carmina Burana_, Mozart’s _Mass in C Minor_ for the Elora Festival of Canada and concerts for Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal and Opéra de Québec. She also joined the Concertgebouw Orchestra, singing the role of La Vierge in Honegger's _Jeanne d’Arc au bûcher_ in Amsterdam, reprised Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_ for Opernhaus Zürich and was soprano soloist in Messiah with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

Further credits have included a concert tour in China with the Salzburg YSP in collaboration with Hantang International Music Festival, Handel’s _Messiah_ and a _Coloratura Spectacular_ with the Edmonton Symphony, Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_ and Fiakermilli in _Arabella_ with the Canadian Opera Company and the Mozart's _Kronöngsmesse and Exsultate, jubilate_ with the Mozarteum Orchestra in Spain.

From 2015 to 2017, Ms. de Sévigné was engaged by Opernhaus Zürich, performing the roles of Hermione in a new production of Trojahn’s _Orest_, Feu, Princesse and Rossignol in Ravel’s _L’enfant et les sortilèges_, as well as the role of Angelica in Haydn’s _Orlando Paladino_. As a member of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble, her roles on the main stage included Despina in _Cosi fan tutte_, First Niece in _Peter Grimes_ and Servilia in _La clemenza di Tito._

She has been awarded prizes, top placement and grants from the Operalia Competition, Orchestre symphonique de Montréal Standard Life Competition, the Montreal International Competition, Vancouver Opera Guild, the Christina and Louis Quilico Competition, the Marcello Giordani Foundation International Vocal Competition and the Annual COC Ensemble Studio Competition.

The Montreal native is also proud to be supported by the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation, SSHRC Bombardier Master’s Research Grant, the Canadian Opera Volunteer Committee as well as the Leanara Foundation in Zürich. Ms. de Sévigné is proud to be a graduate of the Zürich IOS Studio, Salzburg YSP and the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble. She holds a Master’s degree in Opera from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor’s degree in Vocal Performance from Montreal’s McGill University.
