Named one of CBC’s Top 30 Canadian Classical Musicians under 30, coloratura soprano Claire de Sévigné was recently nominated for a 2016 Classical Album of the Year JUNO award for her Naxos album of Vivaldi Cantatas featuring Maestro Kevin Mallon and the Aradia Ensemble. As the Queen of the Night with the Opera Theater of St. Louis, de Sévigné “dispatched the high-flown coloratura with laser-like precision and tonal beauty”. Her most recent success has been with the Savonlinna Opera Festival, Opernhaus Zürich and Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in the role of Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_, in which she was hailed for her “sparkling top notes and vocal brilliance, lightness and finesse”.

In the 2018-19 season, de Sévigné makes her debut with Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam as Vierge in Honegger’s _Jeanne d’Arc au Bucher_, reprises the role of Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_ for Opernhaus Zurich, and sings _Messiah_ with Bilbao Orkestra Sinfonikoa and Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Further ahead she will return to the Savonlinna Festival Finland and to Opernhaus Zurich and perform a season at the Grand Théâtre de Genève.

In 2017-18 de Sévigné made a successful role debut as Fiakermilli in Strauss _Arabella_ with the Canadian Opera Company, where she also sang the role of Blonde in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_. Other engagements included a concert tour in China with the Salzburg YSP in collaboration with Hantang International Music Festival, Handel _Messiah_ with the Edmonton Symphony, Previn’s _Honey and Rue_ with the Niagara Symphony, and Mozart C Minor Mass with the Niagara Chorus.

From 2015 to 2017, de Sévigné spent her time with Opernhaus Zürich performing the roles of Hermione in a new production of Manfred _Trojahn Orest_, Feu, Princesse and Rossignol in Ravel _L’enfant et les sortilèges_, as well as the principal role of Angelica in Haydn _Orlando Paladino_. Additionally, she performed the role of Die Modestin in _Der Rosenkavalier_ with the Salzburg Festival’s Young Artist Project. As a graduate of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, her roles on the main stage included Despina in _Così fan tutti_, First Niece in Peter Grimes, Ida in _Die Fledermaus_ and Servilia in _La clemenza di Tito_. As a cover artist, she was responsible for the role of Constance in _Les Dialogues des Carmélites_. During her Master’s degree in opera at the University of Toronto de Sévigné performed Flaminia in _Il mondo della luna_, Cunegonde in _Candide_ and the title roles in _Lucia di Lammermoor_ and _Hansel and Gretel_. She created the role of Oksana in _The Enslavement and Liberation of Oksana G._ for Tapestry New Opera and at the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, she sang Cleopatra in _Giulio Cesare_ with Thirteen Strings Orchestra. During her Bachelor’s of vocal performance studies at Opera McGill, she added Lisette in _La Rondine_ and Lucia in _The Rape of Lucretia_ to her repertoire.

A Semi-finalist in Placido Domingo’s Operalia Competition in Guadalajara, she has been awarded prizes, top placement and grants from the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal Standard Life Competition, the Montreal International Competition, Vancouver Opera Guild, the Christina and Louis Quilico Competition, the Marcello Giordani Foundation International Vocal Competition and the Annual COC Ensemble Studio Competition. She is also proud to be supported by the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation, SSHRC Bombardier Master’s Research Grant, and the Canadian Opera Volunteer Committee.
