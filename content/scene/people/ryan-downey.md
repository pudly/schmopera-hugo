Ryan is fresh off a number of notable debuts; the first being onstage at the Place des Arts Salle Wilfred Pelletier as a finalist in the Opéra de Montréal's Atelier Lyrique competition and secondly with Toronto Operetta Theatre as Corcoran in *HMS Pinafore*. Ryan is currently busy preparing for JS Bach's *Easter Oratorio* in Toronto, a program of arias with the Timmins Symphony Orchestra and a recital at the Toronto Arts and Letters club in early 2016.
