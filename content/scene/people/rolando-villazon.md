The recipient of the 2014 Richard Tucker Award and the 2014 Beverly Sills Artist Award, Michael Fabiano is the first-ever winner of both awards in the same year, and is considered one of the greatest young tenors in the world today. Of his performance as Oronte in *I Lombardi* with Opera Orchestra of New York, The New York Times wrote: “What everyone who attended a concert by the Opera Orchestra of New York at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday night seemed to be thinking when the show was over might have been summarized in a Twitter post: ‘Michael Fabiano OMG.’ The sentiment was evident whenever that tenor opened his mouth, to judge by the prolonged ovations and shouts that followed.”

Mr. Fabiano opens the current season with San Francisco Opera in performances of Rodolfo in Verdi’s *Luisa Miller*. He then sings back to back operas at Opernhaus Zürich: firstly, Rodolfo in a new production of *La bohème*, and then the Duke of Mantua in *Rigoletto*. He performs the tragic poet Lensky in *Eugene Onegin* at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; revisits the Duke in *Rigoletto*, this time with Opera National de Paris; returns to San Francisco Opera for performances of the title role of *Don Carlo*; and closes the season as Jacopo Foscari in another Verdi rarity, *I due Foscari*, with Teatro Real de Madrid.
