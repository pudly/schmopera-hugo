In other repertoire, he made his first appearance with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, singing Duca in Act III of *Rigoletto* in the company’s annual Stars of Lyric Opera concert conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, at Millennium Park.

He returned to New Israeli Opera and Opera Vlaandaren for Leopold in *La Juive*, a role he has also sung at the Mikhailovsky Theater in St. Petersburg and Utah Opera for his first performances of the Duca di Mantua in *Rigoletto*.
