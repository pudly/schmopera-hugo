Kathleen Kim has been a regular fixture on the stage of The Metropolitan Opera for the past decade with appearances as Tytania (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*) under James Conlon, Olympia in Bartlett Sher’s production of *Les contes d’Hoffmann* and Blondchen (*Die Entführung aus dem Serail*), both conducted by James Levine, Oscar (*Un ballo in maschera*) under Kirill Petrenko, Madame Mao (*Nixon in China*) directed by Peter Sellars and conducted by John Adams, and Zerbinetta (*Ariadne auf Naxos*) conducted by Fabio Luisi.
 
Ever keen to expand her repertoire, Kathleen has made several role debuts over the past seasons including Lucia (*Lucia di Lammermoor*) at Sarasota Opera and La Fée in Massenet’s *Cendrillon* at Opéra de Lille. A winning collaboration with Laurent Pelly has brought the roles of Fire, Princess and the Nightingale in his highly acclaimed new production of Ravel’s *L’enfant et les sortilèges* at the Glyndebourne Festival and Teatro dell’Opera di Roma, as well as *Les contes d’Hoffmann* at the Gran Teatre del Liceu under Stéphane Denève. 
 
Kathleen Kim made her European debut as Marie (*La Fille du regiment*) for the Asociación Bilbaína de Amigos de la Ópera, and has subsequently appeared as Olympia in the acclaimed Richard Jones’ staging of the opera for Bayerische Staatsoper, as Oscar (*Un Ballo in maschera*) for La Monnaie, Zerbinetta (*Ariadne auf Naxos*) for Oper Frankfurt and Tytania (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*) for the Glyndebourne Festival. On the concert platform she also recently made a critically acclaimed BBC Proms debut in *Nixon in China* and joined L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande in a reprise of her acclaimed roles in *L’enfant et les sortilèges* under Charles Dutoit. 
  
A native Korean, Kathleen Kim has a strong presence in her homeland and was the guest soloist at the Independence Day Celebration Concert of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra in 2010, conducted by Myung-Wung Chung. In recent seasons she has joined the orchestra and Mo Chung for Mahler’s Symphony Nos.8 and 2 and Beethoven’s Symphony No.9, recorded and released on the Deutsche Grammophon label. 

This season Kathleen Kim returns to the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra for Carmina Burana under Yves Abel and Beethoven’s Symphony No.9 under Christoph Eschenbach. Elsewhere, she makes her debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic performing her celebrated interpretation of Madame Mao under John Adams, and sings Mahler’s Symphony No.2 with the Charlotte Symphony under Christopher Warren-Green.
