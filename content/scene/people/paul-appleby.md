Young American tenor Paul Appleby has already earned a strong reputation for his expressive acting, interpretative depth and versatility and has won great praise for performances of Stravinsky’s Tom Rakewell (*The Rake’s Progress*), Handel’s Jonathan (*Saul*), Brian in Nico Muhly’s *Two Boys* and Mozart’s Tamino (*Die Zauberflöte*) among others. A graduate of both The Juillard School and The Lindemann Program, Appleby has worked regularly alongside James Levine at The Metropolitan Opera, most recently as David (*Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg*) and in the current season for his debut as Belmonte (*Die Entführung aus dem Serail*).

A versatile performer, Appleby is as comfortable on the concert platform or recital stage as he is on the grand stages of the world’s opera houses. The current season brings a number of debuts including at the San Francisco Opera as Tamino, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for Mozart’s *Requiem* under Gustavo Dudamel, at London’s Wigmore Hall in recital with Malcolm Martineau, and as Berlioz’ Benedict at the 2016 Glyndebourne Festival.
