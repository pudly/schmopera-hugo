Hailed by *The New York Times* for her "bright, clear voice and impressive coloratura technique," South Korean soprano Hyesang Park is also making a name for herself in international competition circles. In the last year, she has placed in three competitions: she recently won first prize in the April 2016 Gerda Lissner Foundation International Competition, in summer 2015 she won second prize and the Audience Choice Award at the Montreal International Musical Competition, followed the next month by winning second place overall in the women’s division in Placido Domingo's International Operalia competition, as well as taking First Prize in the women's Zarzuela.

During summer 2016, Miss Park served as a "Young Artist in Residence" at the Music & Vin 2016 Festival in Beaune, France. Of note this 2016-17 season are her performances in announced productions of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette with the Korea National Opera in Seoul, Korea in December 2016, and as the First Wood Nymph in Dvořák’s Rusalka with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in February and March 2017. Future engagements include her United Kingdom opera debut with the celebrated Glyndebourne Festival.

In November 2014, Hyesang Park made her American opera debut as Fiorilla in Juilliard Opera's
production of Rossini's *Il Turco in Italia*. With regards to this performance, *Opera News* magazine remarked, "Her solid, refined fioritura delivery was matched by glamour, temperament and, above all, an ability to put bel canto splendor to expressive use." For the 2015-16 season Miss Park was invited to join the Lindemann Young Artists Program of the Metropolitan Opera while also taking advanced degree work at Juilliard.

The recipient of a Toulmin Foundation Scholarship, in June 2015 Miss Park graduated with her Masters Degree from Juilliard in New York City.
