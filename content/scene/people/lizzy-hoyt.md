Powerhouse performer, LIZZY HOYT is a unique vocalist who transcends the limitations of musical genre.

A nationally recognized Celtic songwriter, singer, and multi-instrumentalist (fiddle, guitar, harp), she has released multiple independent albums, two music videos, and given countless concert tours across Canada. Known for bringing history to life with her songs like “Vimy Ridge”, “New Lady on the Prairie”, and “White Feather”, she was awarded the QUEEN’S DIAMOND JUBILEE MEDAL by the Governor General of Canada for her outstanding contribution to commemorating Canadian veterans and history through music. In May 2022, she will release her fifth album, The Parting Glass. A collection of her favourite traditional songs, this intimate project features Lizzy’s sublime vocals and poignant arranging.

In contrast to her folk music, Lizzy has recently added outstanding opera performances to her name! In the title role of Purcell’s DIDO AND AENEAS (Manitoba Underground Opera), Opera Canada praised her deeply felt performance which “infused the entire production with aching humanity”. Her upcoming season includes exciting professional debuts: the title role of Rossini’s LA CENERENTOLA (Cinderella) for Manitoba Opera and Brott Opera followed by her debut with MANITOBA CHAMBER ORCHESTRA singing baroque arias by Vivaldi and Handel. Equally at home with comedic characters, Opera Canada praised her “delicious, tongue-in-cheek characterization infused by keen comedic gifts” as she brought to life a passionate, positive, and fearless JULIA CHILD in Hoiby’s one-woman opera, "Bon Appétit” for Little Opera Company.  
  
Baroque and bel canto music have been a natural fit with her background in traditional music and fiddling. Her sparkling coluratura, original ornamentation, rich mezzo sound and dramatic sense allow her to deliver exceptional performances ranging from chamber cantatas to pinnacle roles such as Rossini’s Cenerentola and Handel’s Ariodante.  
  
Passionate about classical song repertoire, Lizzy has performed with Symphony of the Kootenays, Lethbridge Symphony and Concordia Symphony and has given recitals for Skywalk Concerts (Virtuosi), Edmonton Recital Society, St. Albert Chamber Music Society, Flipside Opera and Art Song Collective, Winnipeg Classical Guitar Society, and Arts on 817.  
  
A member of Manitoba Opera’s 2020 Emerging Artist Program, she continues private studies with her teacher and mentor, Tracy Dahl, as well as through programs like Tafelmusik’s Baroque Summer Institute. She holds a Post-Bacceleaureate Diploma with distinction from the University of Manitoba and a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sociology from the University of Alberta.
