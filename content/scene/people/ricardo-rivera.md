Concert performance highlights of standard repertoire include the baritone solos in: *Ein deutsches Requiem* with both The New York Choral Society and The Westchester Chorale Society; *Carmina Burana* with Monmouth Civic Chorus; and Bach’s “Coffee Cantata” at the White Mountains Music Festival.

Mr. Rivera is a graduate of Mannes College the New School for Music where his B.M. M.M. and PDPL were conferred. As a Mannes Opera Young Artist, he performed the title role in *Don Giovanni*, Ford in *Falstaff*, Don Alfonso in *Così fan tutte*, and Aeneas in *Dido and Aeneas*. At Mannes, he was mentored by Met Opera conductor and Music Director at The Glimmerglass Festival, Joseph Colaneri and the great, late American mezzo-soprano Regina Resnik.

Mr. Rivera was an apprentice singer with Santa Fe Opera, a young artist with Opera North, and an Eva and Marc Stern Fellow at SongFest where he coached with Martin Katz, Graham Johnson, and composer Lori Laitman on her music. As an apprentice artist at Chautauqua Opera, he covered Enrico in *Lucia di Lammermoor*; performed the Sergeant and covered Lescaut in *Manon Lescaut*; and performed in two concerts with the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra.

In a review of Mr. Rivera's performance in Sophia Gubaidulina's *Perception* with multi-Grammy Award–winning ensembles eighth blackbird and the Pacifica Quartet, the Chicago Tribune declared him "amazingly precise of musical and verbal gesture." In continuation of his commitment to the vitality of contemporary music, Mr. Rivera performed Steven Stucky's *Four poems of A.R. Ammons* with the FLUX Quartet, the world premiere of Reinaldo Moya's *Soliquio en las olas* with the Arts Symphony Orchestra, and the world premiere of Aaron Dai's *Con furia* with the Chelsea Symphony. 21st-century operatic roles which have been composed for and have been performed by Mr. Rivera include leading roles in Robert Cuckson's *A Night of Pity* and *Horace: a Portrait*, Christopher Park's *Phaedra and Hippolytus*, Alexander Berezowsky's *The Nine Billion Names of God*, and Andrew McManus's *Killing the Goat*.

Mr. Rivera won 1st Prize in the Eastern Region of the 2012 Met Opera National Council Auditions (MONC) which led him to the semi-finals of that competition. He received two awards upon graduating from Mannes College: the Richard F. Gold Career Grant in 2008 and the Michael Sisca Memorial Opera Award in 2012.  He was awarded 3rd Prize in the Gerda Lissner Competition, a Career Grant from the Licia Albanese-Puccini Competition, 1st and Audience Prizes in the NY Lyric Opera Competition, and Encouragement Awards from the Opera Index, Career Bridges, and Connecticut Opera Guild Competitions.
