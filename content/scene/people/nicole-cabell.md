Universally acclaimed for her velvety timbre and finely nuanced interpretations, American soprano Nicole Cabell continues to demonstrate her incredible versatility in repertoire ranging from Baroque to contemporary on the world’s greatest opera and concert stages as well as on disc. 

Last season saw Nicole Cabell sing her first staged Bess in James Robinson’s acclaimed production of _Porgy and Bess_ for English National Opera, conducted by John Wilson. At home in the US, she returned to Cincinatti as Juliette (_Roméo et Juliette_), and joined Pittsburgh Opera as Mimì. This season she sings Donna Elvira (_Don Giovanni_) at Michigan Opera Theatre under Christopher Allen; and next season, she makes her debut at Theater an der Wien in Matthew Wild’s new production of _Porgy and Bess_.

Ms Cabell’s recent debut as Handel’s _Alcina_ at Grand Théâtre de Genève under Leonardo García Alarcón – praised by _Opera Magazine_ for her ​“rounded and silky \[tone\], projected with ease, immaculately controlled” – Nicole Cabell subsequently reunited with Alarcón last season for her debut at Dutch National Opera as Flavia in Cavalli’s _Eliogabalo_, alongside appearances in full lyric roles, such as Violetta (_La traviata_) at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and Mimì (_La bohème_) at Cincinnati Opera and for her debut at Opéra national de Paris.

Nicole Cabell, was the winner of the 2005 BBC Singer of the World Competition and is a Decca recording artist. Her solo debut album, ​“Soprano” was named ​“Editor’s Choice” by Gramophone and received the 2007 Georg Solti Orphée d’Or from the French Académie du Disque Lyrique.
