Scott Gabriel studied trumpet performance and orchestral conducting at the Universities of Calgary and Toronto and has attended countless workshops in early music and performance practice. His twenty-plus years of work as a symphony musician, conductor, and pedagogue have taken him across Canada and abroad. His greatest fondness is for the music of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, for new music, and for primitive theatre. Scott conducts and teaches throughout Canada, having recently moved to Toronto from Montreal, where he conducted and taught at the Petits chanteurs du Mont-Royal, the McGill Conservatory, and the Westmount Youth Orchestra, and where he led several choirs. He returns to South Africa, summers, to work with their National Youth Orchestra. As a conductor, orchestra musician, choral leader, and experienced teacher, Scott brings a breadth of musical and creative skills to The Friends of Gravity.

As composer and arranger, Scott is drawn to intimacy of scale and directness of expression. His arrangements of existing music build upon the qualities and impact of existing works, bringing expressive relevancy to a contemporary audience.
