Tenor Marcel d’Entremont is becoming recognized across Canada for both his powerful voice and sincere stage presence. A former first prize winner of the Atlantic Young Artist Competition, Marcel also placed first in the vocal division of the National Music Festival of Canada and claimed the Grand Award for overall best performer.

In November of 2018, he was named the winner of the Wirth Vocal Prize at McGill University, which resulted in solo recitals at La Chapelle historique du Bon-Pasteur in Montreal and the Richard Bradshaw Theatre of the Four Seasons Centre in Toronto.

Marcel has a keen interest in many styles of singing and was a featured soloist for six years with the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, performing alongside musicians from around the world for audiences in the tens of thousands. He was also invited to perform at the inauguration ceremony of The Honourable Arthur J. LeBlanc, Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. Marcel has been a resident artist at the Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance, the National Arts Center’s Young Artist Program, the Art of Song Institute with the Toronto Summer Music, and was a Yulanda M. Farris Young Artist with the Vancouver Opera. In 2021, he was an Equilibrium Young Artist, working with soprano Barbara Hannigan.

Marcel’s role performances include Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor and Tamino in _Die Zauberflöte_ with Opera McGill, Il Podesta in _La Finta Giardiniera_ and Luiz in _The Gondoliers_ with Opera Nova Scotia, Rodolfo in _La bohème_ with Opera Saskatoon, and two tours with Jeunesses Musicales du Canada as the title role in Gounod’s _Roméo et Juliette_ as well as Alfredo in _La Traviata_. In concert, he has performed Britten’s Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings with the PEI Symphony Orchestra, and appeared as the tenor soloist in Handel’s _Messiah_ with the Orchestre classique de Montréal. In 2016 Marcel made his international opera debut as Don Ottavio with Opéra de Rouen in Rouen, France and at the Château de Versailles, as a laureate of the Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques. Most recently, Marcel performed the role of Rodolfo over 20 times in a cross-Canada tour of _La bohème_ with Against the Grain Theatre. This production was the first live broadcast of a professional opera in Canada and has been nominated for a Canadian Screen Award in the category of Best Performing Arts Program. 

In 2020, Marcel was named one of the Top 30 Under 30 classical musicians in Canada by CBC Music.
