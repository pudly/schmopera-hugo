Tunisian-Canadian mezzo-soprano Rihab Chaieb has drawn international recognition for her clear, sensuous vocal tone and her dramatic flair. With a versatile instrument that allows her to shine in repertoire from Monteverdi, Handel and Mozart through Bizet, Verdi and Glass, the Canadian mezzo is a prominent new talent on the world’s major stages.

In the 2022-23 season, Chaieb makes both notable debuts and anticipated returns: she brings her acclaimed interpretation of Carmen to both the Canadian Opera Company and Calgary Opera and makes her LA Opera debut as Cherubino in James Gray’s new production of _Le nozze di Figaro_, conducted by James Conlon. At Grand Théâtre de Genève she appears as La mère Meryem in the world-premiere of Christian Jost’s _Voyage vers l’espoir_ and makes her Bayerische Staatsoper debut as Fenena in Verdi’s _Nabucco,_ conducted by Daniele Rustioni.

A regular performer on the concert platform, this season Rihab Chaieb joins Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and Richard Egarr in Handel’s _Messiah_, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and Otto Tausk for Berlioz’s _Les nuits d’été,_ and with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, she performs her first Ruggiero in Handel’s _Alcina_. In recital, she performs alongside pianist Brian Zeger at the Kennedy Center, presented by Vocal Arts DC and joins pianist Valeria Polunina for a first performance in Tallinn, Estonia.

The 2021-22 season included Rihab Chaieb’s debut at Washington National Opera as Dorabella in _Così fan tutte_, her first Penelope for a European concert tour and recording of _Il ritorno d’Ulisse in patria_ with Ensemble I Gemelli, a return to Opéra National de Montpellier as Maddalena in Marie-Eve Signeyrole’s new staging of _Rigoletto_, a debut at Palm Beach Opera in the title role of Carmen, and a return to The Metropolitan Opera as Nefertiti in Phelim McDermott’s revelatory production of Philip Glass’ _Akhnaten_, conducted by Karen Kamensek.
