American tenor Carl Tanner begins the 2015/16 season with a concert appearance as Pinkerton in *Madama Butterfly* with the Minnesota Orchestra under the baton of Andrew Litton. He next joins Opera Colorado to sing his signature role Radames in *Aida* (a role he sang to great acclaim at the Metropolitan Opera last season). Mr. Tanner then appears on tour with orchestras around the USA to promote his re-released Christmas CD, *Hear the Angel Voices*. 

In the spring of 2016, Carl returns to London to sing the role of Luigi in Puccini’s *Il Tabarro* at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden before travelling to Honolulu to appear as Manrico in *Il Trovatore* for Hawaii Opera Theatre.
