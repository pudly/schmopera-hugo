Irish mezzo-soprano Rachel Kelly is a recent graduate of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden’s Jette Parker Young Artist Programme where, over the last two seasons, she has attracted considerable attention for her portrayals on the main stage as Pisana (*I due Foscari*), Zaida (*Il turco in Italia*) and Mercédès (*Carmen*). Her performance as Mirinda in Kasper Holten's *L’Ormindo* conducted by Christian Curnyn (which marked the first ever collaboration between the Royal Opera House and Shakespeare’s Globe) was singled out for its “rich sensuality’ of voice” and “glowing warmth”. Her performance of the Cat in *El gato con botas* (*Puss in Boots*) at the Linbury Theatre was described by *The Telegraph* as “a special delight”, and she earned unanimous praise for her performance as Proserpina (*Orfeo*) at London’s Roundhouse.

Rachel’s current season highlights include a role debut as Nerone (*Agrippina*) with the Irish Chamber Orchestra conducted by Jonathan Cohen, a reprise of Mercédès (*Carmen*) at the Royal Opera House, the creation of the role of Catherine (*The Devil Inside*) for the Scottish Opera which tours both the UK and Canada, and she makes her company debut as Nancy (*Albert Herring*) with Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. She gives a concert performance in the title role of Il* vologeso* with Classical Opera under Ian Page at London’s Cadogan Hall and she makes her role debut as Teresa in a concert performance of *La sonnambula* with Orchestre de Chambre de Paris under Christopher Franklin at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées. In concert Rachel gives a recital for the Oxford Lieder Festival, she performs Beethoven’s *Missa Solemnis* with the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland under Cristian Măcelaru, and she makes a guest appearance at Plácido Domingo’s concert at Dublin’s 3Arena.
