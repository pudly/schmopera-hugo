His roles include the title role in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>, the Four Villains in <em>Les Contes d'Hoffmann</em>, Mephistopheles in <em>Faust</em>, Raimondo in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, Banquo in <em>Macbeth</em>, Colline in <em>La Bohème</em>, and Claudio in <em>Aggrippina</em>.

	<span class="color_14">During the 2012/13 season, Christian traveled to Perm, Russia, where he recorded the title role in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> with conductor Teodor Currentzis for Sony Classical Records (due for release in early 2014). He continued to Amsterdam to make his house and role debuts as Gessler in Rossini's <em>Guillaume Tell</em> with De Nederlandse Opera, followed by another house debut with Dallas Opera as Timur in <em>Turandot</em>. Christian continued the season with a significant role debut, singing his first Four Villains in <em>Les Contes d'Hoffmann</em> with San Francisco Opera. "Bass-baritone Christian Van Horn's resonant vocalism and suave, menacing presence animated Lindorf, Coppélius, Dr. Miracle and Dapertutto; the latter's 'Scintille, diamant' yielded an episode of focused brilliance." (Opera News, August 2013) The summer then saw him back across the ocean with the Gothenburg Symphoniker in Sweden for a concert performance of Ça Ira, written by Roger Waters.</span>

	<span class="color_14">To open the 2013/14 season, Van Horn returned to Canadian Opera Company as Colline in <em>La Bohème</em>. Most recently, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut under the baton of James Levine as Pistola in the Met's new <em>Falstaff</em> which was presented around the globe as part of the HD Broadcast series. Christian then sang more performances of Colline in the Met's beloved Zeffirelli production, showcasing his "sturdy voice and commanding presence." (New York Times, January 2014) He rounds out the season with a return to Lyric Opera of Chicago as Publio in <em>La Clemenza di Tito</em>. This production marks Mr. Van Horn's tenth outing with the company, having most recently delivered triumphant performances of Raimondo in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> in 2011. Opera News proclaimed that Christian "contributed some of the most beautiful singing of the evening." (December 2011)</span>

	<span class="color_14">Christian will spend much of the 2014/15 season with San Francisco Opera where he will be seen in six different productions, including the company's season opening performances of <em>Norma</em> (Oroveso) under Maestro Nicola Luisotti. San Francisco will also hear Van Horn in two role debuts: Alidoro in <em>La Cenerentola</em> and Narbal in <em>Les Troyens</em>, conducted by Donald Runnicles. The remainder of his San Francisco season includes Colline and the world premiere of SFO-commissioned <em>La Chociara</em> by Marco Tutino. Christian makes his San Diego Opera debut as Colline in early 2015 and also returns to the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich as Offenbach's Four Villains. The season is completed with concert performances and a recording of composer Joseph Summer's new opera, The Tempest, which Van Horn will headline as Prospero.</span>

These include Bizet's Carmen with Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic for EMI, a live recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra, and the world premiere of David Carlson's <em>Anna Karenina</em> for Signum Classics with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and Maestro Stewart Robertson. Christian may be seen on DVD in the Salzburg Festival's production of <em>Roméo et Juliette</em>, conducted by Yannick Nezet-Seguin (Deutsche Grammaphon) as well as in Christoph Loy's production of <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em> with the Bayerische Staatsoper for Medici Arts.</span>
