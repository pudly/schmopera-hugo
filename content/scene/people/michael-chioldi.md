American baritone Michael Chioldi has quickly gained the reputation as one of the most sought-after dramatic baritones of his generation. Praised for his "warm, rich tone" (Opera News) and "deeply communicative phrasing" (The Baltimore Sun), he has received unanimous acclaim from critics and audiences around the world for his portrayals of the dramatic baritone roles of Verdi, Puccini, and Strauss. His recent role debuts include the title roles in Verdi's *Rigoletto* with the Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco, Macbeth with Palm Beach Opera, and *Nabucco* with Lyric Opera Baltimore; as Conte di Luna in *Il Trovatore* with Utah Opera; and as Rodrigo in *Don Carlo* with Austin Lyric Opera.

Chioldi's 2016-17 season began in September with his return to Virginia Opera for his role debut as Tonio in *Pagliacci*. He returned to New Orleans Opera in November in the title role of Verdi's *Macbeth*, as well as to the Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco debuting the role of Iago in *Otello*. Chioldi then returns to the Palm Beach Opera to reprise his portrayal of the title role in *Rigoletto* in March. Le Nous Cultura praised his Rigoletto debut last season, saying, "The star of the night was without a doubt the baritone Michael Chioldi, whose powerful, virile and dramatic voice made of the production something absolutely essential to hear." He finishes the season with Austin Lyric Opera in performances of *Madama Butterfly* in May.

Chioldi has performed at nearly every major American opera house, including The Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Washington National Opera and Los Angeles Opera.
