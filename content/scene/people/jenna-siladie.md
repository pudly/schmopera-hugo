Jenna returned to the company this winter covering the role of the La Princesa in *El Gato con Botas* (Montsalvatge). Jenna happily made another company and role debut in March 2016 performing the lead role of Leontine in the US premiere of *L'amant Anonyme*, composed by Chevalier de Saint-Georges at the Little Opera Theater of NY and joined the Carolina Philharmonic for their “Night at the Opera” in April 2016.
