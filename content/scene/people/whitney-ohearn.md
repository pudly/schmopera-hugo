Praised for her “warm and expressive voice and an amazing sense of line” (Ottawa Citizen), Whitney O’Hearn has already attracted attention in the vocal world. The Ottawa native received her undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Ottawa, and recently completed further graduate studies at the University of Toronto. She is also an alumni of the National Art Centre’s Summer Music Institute young artist program.

Whitney has distinguished herself in many operatic roles, including The Sorceress in Purcell’s *Dido and Aeneas* with Schola Cantorum and Theatre of Early Music, the title role in Bizet’s *Carmen* with the University of Ottawa Opera, as well as Mercedes in Bizet’s *Carmen* with the wildly successful *Carmen on Tap*.

On the concert stage, she has performed as soloist with the Ottawa Choral Society, the Ottawa International Chamber Festival, Festival Pontiac Enchanté, Stratford Summer Music Festival, Prince Edward County Music Festival, The Capital Chamber Choir, The University of Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, The Talisker Players, and The Canadian Guitar Quartet.

Ms. O’Hearn is a founding member of Collectìf, a Toronto ensemble dedicated to exploring and expanding the world of artsong performance, and to presenting innovative song-based theatre.

Recent engagements include an east coast recital tour of romantic French and Spanish repertoire with soprano Stephanie Higgins. In the 2016-2017 season, Whitney was featured as the mezzo soloist with The Talisker Players in their presentation of “Land of the Silver Birch”, as well as staged productions of settings of Debussy’s *Fête galantes* in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre at the Four Seasons Centre and Schubert’s *Winterreise* with Collectìf.
