Acclaimed for her “emotional yet unaffected quality of performance with true clear voice”, soprano Sarah Vardy impresses and delights audiences across Canada, Europe, Mexico, and China. “She stands out wherever she sings with a combination of vocal passion and rich characterization and musicality.” Her European debut of Tosca was “Victorious” and she continues to “convey deep emotion and rich and unique vocal tones.”

This fall Sarah is excited to rejoin City Opera Vancouver Performing the role of Sophie in *Nigredo Hotel*.

Performing Opera, Oratorio, small and large concerts,  Ms. Vardy sang with the Opera Wroclawska (Poland), Regina Symphony Orchestra, Saskatoon Symphony, Highlands Opera Studio, Calgary Concert Opera, Saskatoon Opera, Pacific Opera (Victoria), City Opera Vancouver, and members of the Victoria Symphony.

Ms. Vardy debuted the role of Eva Johnson in Pauline by Margaret Atwood and Tobin Stokes which was described by *Opera Canada* “sung with catty, self-righteous intensity – just what the part needed.” She performed *La Gioconda* with Calgary Concert Opera. This season she sings Mendelssohn’s *Elijah*, Mozarts *Requiem* and performs various opera works in two concerts for the Mexican community Los Cabos.

Sarah participated in Highland Opera Studio to study and perform *Madama Butterfly* and *Tosca* with renowned Canadian tenor Richard Margison and soprano Christiane Riel.  She twice has performed in Montreal as a Laureate of Les Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques for whom she also competed in Italy at International Singing Contest where she was a prize winner.
