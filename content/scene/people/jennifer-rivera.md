Jennifer Rivera has earned a spot as one of the most sought after and versatile lyric mezzo-sopranos of her generation by consistently delivering exceptional vocalism, superb musicianship, and a powerful stage presence. Her successful European debut as Sesto in *La clemenza di Tito* with the Teatro Regio di Torino directed by Graham Vick and conducted by Roberto Abaddo was followed by her debut with the Berlin Staatsoper as Rosina in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, and Nerone in a new production of *Agrippina* conducted by Rene Jacobs. She was then invited to sing Licida in *L’Olimpiade* by Pergolesi at the Innsbruck Early Music Festival, and returned to the Berlin Staatsoper as both Rosina, and as Ismene in a new production of *Antigone* by Traetta conducted by Maestro Jacobs.

The 2015-2016 season features Jennifer Rivera’s debut with Dallas Opera, in the premiere of Mark Adamo’s *Becoming Santa Claus*, and a return to New Orleans Opera to reprise the role of Sister Helen Prejean in *Dead Man Walking*. One of her most frequently performed roles, Rosina in Rossini’s *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, will serve as the vehicle for her debut with Austin Opera. On the concert stage, she appears with the Music of the Baroque (Bach Cantata 119) and with the Houston Symphony (*Messiah*).

Ms. Rivera’s 2014-2015 calendar featured a return to Portland Opera for Prince Orlofsky in *Die Fledermaus*, and her debuts with Opera Parallèle, as Sister Helen Prejean in *Dead Man Walking*, and Brisbane Baroque, as the title role in Paul Curran’s production of *Faramondo*.

Praised repeatedly by the New York Times for her “radiant mezzo soprano” (*Elmer Gantry*), her “warm dark tone” (*Barbiere*), and “fresh ready singing”, (*Hansel*) her voice has also been described by the Times as being “dark, musical, and very agile” (*Cenerentola*) and possessing “richness, ease, and exactness” (*L’Etoile*).

Previous season’s engagements for Ms. Rivera include Rosina with Opera Pacific, Angelina in *La cenerentola* with Florida Grand Opera, and Ines in Donizetti’s *Maria Padilla* with Washington Concert Opera. She also appeared at Avery Fisher Hall with the American Symphony Orchestra singing Varese’s *Offrandes* and with the Polish National Opera as Orsini in *Lucrezia Borgia* conducted by Will Crutchfield. Other engagements for the mezzo have included her debut with New Orleans Opera as Stephano in *Roméo et Juliette* and her return to Portland Opera for Rosina.
