A native of St. Paul Minnesota, soprano Sara Gartland earned raves as Marie in Des Moines Metro Opera's production of _Wozzeck_. Mark Thomas Ketterson with _Opera News_ Magazine exclaimed, "The poignant Marie of Sara Gartland was something of a revelation. Gartland delivered the character through a gleaming column of sound that remained incisive yet consistently beautiful throughout the range up to the top C."

Engagements for last season included Micaëla in _Carmen_ and Musetta in _La bohème_ with The Dallas Opera, Violetta in _La Traviata_ with Arizona Opera, and Marie in _Wozzeck_ with Des Moines Metro Opera. The 2019-2020 season sees her as the cover of Rusalka with Canadian Opera Company, Gretel in _Hansel and Gretel_ with San Diego Opera, Beethoven's Mass in C Major with the Jacksonville Symphony, a role and company debut as Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_ with Minnesota Opera, and a return to her home house in Des Moines as Lisa in _The Queen of Spades_.

A lover of opera and operetta as well as contemporary works, Ms. Gartland has sung a plethora of roles displaying her talent for dramatic storytelling and comedy.

She has also developed close working relationships with some of the best regional opera houses in the country. Performances include the title roles of _Rusalka_ and _Jenufa_, Juliette in _Roméo et Juliette_, and Alexandra in _Regina_ with Des Moines Metro Opera, Rosalinde in _Die Fledermaus_, Violetta in _La Traviata_, Curley's Wife in _Of Mice and Men_, and Alexandra in _Regina_ with Utah Opera, Rusalka in _Rusalka_ and Josephine in _HMS Pinafore_ with Arizona Opera, Marzelline in _Fidelio_ with Opera Omaha, Gretel in _Hansel and Gretel_ with Opera San Jose, Adina in _L'elisir d'amore_ with Austin Lyric Opera, Adalgisa (cover) in _Norma_ and Zenna Briggs (cover) in Michel van der Aa's 3D opera _Sunken Garden_ with The Dallas Opera, and Norina in _Don Pasquale_ with Opera Iowa.

As a member of the prestigious Adler Fellow Program at San Francisco Opera, Ms. Gartland sang numerous roles including performances of Micaëla in _Carmen_, Pat/Ann in the world premiere of Christopher Theofandis' _Heart of a Soldier_, Gerhilde in _Die Walküre_, Kate Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_, and covered Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ while also singing Barbarina, which was her San Francisco Opera main stage debut.
