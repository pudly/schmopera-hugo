A native of St. Paul Minnesota, soprano Sara Gartland earned raves as Jenufa in _Jenufa_ with the Des Moines Metro Opera. Opera News exclaimed, “an exciting breakthrough performance from Sara Gartland in the title role…As Janáček’s heartrending heroine, Gartland displayed a most individual timbre and a considerable reserve of lyric weight in midrange. Her prayer in Act II was ineffable. Gartland has always been an appealing singer; here she emerged as a complete artist.” And Opera Today said, “In the title role, Sara Gartland is serving notice with a star-making performance of the first magnitude. Ms. Gartland not only has an incisive thrust to her robust, soprano, but also she has a charismatic and persuasive dramatic delivery that commands out attention. There is no requirement of this demanding role that eludes her artistic fulfillment. She is able to first suggest an irresponsible, even cruel girlishness with ease, encompass the sufferings of a young mother betrayed in love, and ultimately assume a tragic stature worthy of a classic Greek heroine. On the way, the soprano displays a full arsenal of effects. Her assured technique allows her to sing evenly throughout the range. Her unerring phrasing and sense of musical line is colored with underlying dramatic intent and infused with subtext. She exhibits meticulous control of even the softest, tenderest phrases, and then turns around on a dime to ravish our ears and stir our souls with throbbing forte exclamations riding easily over the full orchestra, that are laden with heartbreaking intent. Her great Act II prayer scene was a study in variety and total immersion in the musico-dramatic effect.” 

Last season for Ms. Gartland included appearing in concert with The Dallas Opera’s Institute for Women Conductors, Rosalinde in _Die Fledermaus_ with Utah Opera, and _Rusalka_ with Des Moines Metro Opera. Engagements for the 2018- 2019 season include Micäela in _Carmen_ and Musetta in _La bohème_ with The Dallas Opera, Violetta in _La Traviata_ with Arizona Opera, and Marie in _Wozzeck_ with Des Moines Metro Opera.
