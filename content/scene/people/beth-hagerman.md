New Brunswick native Beth Hagerman is a Toronto-based soprano and one of the 2014-2015 Rebanks Family Fellows at the Glenn Gould School (GGS). In November, she was featured in the Canadian Opera Company's Noon Hour Concert series in a program of chamber music, including Bolcom’s *Let Evening Come* and Chausson’s *Chanson Perpétuelle*. Miss Hagerman recorded a short recital with John O’Conor in CBC’s Studio One in Vancouver in December to be broadcasted later this year. Also, the celebrated new series, Pocket Concerts presented Miss Hagerman in December in a program entitled, *Songs From My Cupboard*, featuring works by Toronto composer and pianist, Peter Tiefenbach.  In October, she performed a recital, Fun with Song, as part of the Colours of Music Festival with Patricia O’Callaghan, Peter Tiefenbach, and Robert Kortgaard. This performance led to a review in The Barrie Examiner which described audiences as “delighted” and Beth’s voice as “enormous” and a “great beauty”.

In the summer of 2014, she was engaged by Maritime Concert Opera to sing Rosalinde in *Die Fledermaus* and by Opera Nova Scotia to appear as Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni*. Her role as Rosalinde was touted by *Opera Canada* as “perfectly cast” with  singing that was “superb”. She also performed the title role in Halifax Summer Opera Festival’s production of Dvořák’s *Rusalka*. In fall 2013, she was involved in the world premiere of the English version of Korngold’s *The Silent Serenade* as Sylvia Lombardi with the GGS. She made her Toronto Operetta Theatre debut in November 2013 as Mari Pepa in their production, *The Saucy Señorita*, based on Ruperto Chapi's zarzuela, *La Revoltosa*. She has performed other leading roles in GGS productions such as in 2011 as Pamina in Mozart’s *The Magic Flute* and in 2012 as Giunone in *La Calisto* by Cavalli. In the summer of 2011, her Antonia in Offenbach’s *Les Contes D’Hoffman* with The Halifax Summer Opera Workshop was lauded by *Opera Canada* as, "spectacular."

Miss Hagerman is a graduate of the Artist Diploma Program in Voice at the Glenn Gould School, where she studied with Monica Whicher and coached with Peter Tiefenbach. In 2010, Ms. Hagerman graduated from Dalhousie University with a Bachelor of Arts with a double major in German and Italian Studies. There, she studied voice with Lucy Hayes-Davis. In 2007, Hagerman obtained her Bachelor of Music from Mount Allison University, where her voice teachers included, Dr. Helen Pridmore and Wendy Nielsen.
