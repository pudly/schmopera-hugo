​Praised for her "full, gleaming sound" (_Chicago Tribune_), Canadian soprano Tracy Cantin "has it all - agility, power and dazzling coloratura" (_Chicago Sun-Times_), not to mention "vocal and physical allure, with interpretive intelligence and stage presence to boot" (_Chicago Tribune_). A graduate of the prestigious Ryan Opera Center at Lyric Opera of Chicago, Cantin won magnificent critical acclaim at Lyric as Berta/_Il barbiere di Siviglia_, has appeared with the company in _Elektra_, _Rigoletto_, _Parsifal_, and most recently in the title role of Donizetti’s demanding _Anna Bolena_, in which she replaced ailing super-star soprano Sondra Radvanovsky. Her operatic repertoire includes Mimi/_La Boheme_, Donna Anna/_Don Giovanni_, Miss Jessel/_Turn of the Screw_, Rosalinde/_Die Fledermaus_, Desdemona/_Otello_, Rusalka/_Rusalka_, Alice Ford/_Falstaff_, Eva/_Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_, and Chrysothemis/_Elektra_. 

​​An avid concert performer, Cantin has been heard as the soprano soloist in Bernstein’s _Songfest_, Handel’s _Messiah_, Schubert’s Mass in Ab, Mozart’s _Requiem_, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 introduced her to Australian audiences, singing alongside Bryn Terfel, under the baton of Sir Andrew Davis, with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Cantin has recently made critically acclaimed debuts with the ​BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Ravinia Festival, Grant Park Festival, Oregon Symphony, Illinois Philharmonic, and the Civic Orchestra of Chicago. Upcoming seasons include performances of Mozart's Requiem, Verdi's Requiem, and Beethoven's Symphony No.9​.

Cantin was a 2016 National Semi-Finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, as well as a top prize recipient of the 2016 Licia-Albanese Puccini Foundation Competition. Among Cantin’s numerous past awards are a 2014 Sullivan Foundation Award, a 2014 Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Emerging Artist Award, and first place in Canada’s prestigious Lois Marshall Memorial Competition (2010). Cantin is a past participant of the Ryan Opera Center and Santa Fe Opera apprentice programs, holds degrees from McGill University (A.Dip’12), the University of Western Ontario (M.Mus’11), and the University of Alberta (B.Mus’08), and has been the grateful recipient of support from the Sylva Gelber Foundation, and Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation.
