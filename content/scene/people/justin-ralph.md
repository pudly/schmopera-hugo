Justin has performed as a soloist with many companies, including Opera in Concert, Toronto Operetta Theatre, the Orpheus Choir of Toronto,  Opera Five, and Opera York. Some of his favourite roles on the operatic stage have included Ferrando in Mozart’s *Cosi Fan Tutte*, and Jupiter in Handel’s *Semele*. On the operetta stage, he has enjoyed playing Eisenstein in Strauss’ *Die Fledermaus*, Kekikako in Offenbach's *Ba-ta-Clan*, Nanki-Poo in Gilbert and Sullivan’s *The Mikado*, Frederick in *The Pirates of Penzance*, and Ralph “T.” Rackstraw in *Starship Pinafore*, a Star Trekified version of Gilbert and Sullivan’s *H.M.S.

On the concert stage, Justin has appeared with the Greater Toronto Philharmonic Orchestra as the tenor soloist in Saint-Saens Christmas Oratorio, and The Nativity According to St. Luke, has sung as the tenor soloist in *Messiah* with several companies, and most recently sang the role of Marius with the Sudbury Symphony and Yes!
