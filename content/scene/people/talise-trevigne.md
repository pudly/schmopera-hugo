American soprano Talise Trevigne begins the 2015-16 season as Pamina (*The Magic Flute*) at Hawaii Opera Theatre, before making her role debut as Cio-Cio-San (*Madama Butterfly*) at North Carolina Opera. She continues to Birmingham Opera to appear in Ricky Ian Gordon’s *Orpheus and Euridice*.  She returns to Fort Worth Opera to create the role of Clara (*JFK*) in David T. Little and Royce Vavrek’s world premiere; later the artist joins Albany Symphony to sing Kernis’ *Love Songs* and during the summer, she sings the title role in *Iris* at Bard Music Festival.

Last season, Talise Trevigne made role debuts as Sister Rose in Jake Heggie’s *Dead Man Walking* with Opera Parallele in San Francisco, and as Ophelia (*Hamlet*) at Fort Worth Opera. She joined Opera Lafayette for a recording and performances of the rarely-heard *L’Epreuve Villageoise*, and appeared in concert in programmes of Mahler’s Fourth Symphony and Barber’s *Knoxville: Summer of 1915* with the Florida Orchestra and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in the UK.

Recent highlights include her appearance as the Heroines in *Les Contes d’Hoffmann* at Knoxville Opera, Opera de Lyon under the baton of Kazushi Ono, and at Israeli Opera with Frederic Chaslin. At Washington National Opera she revived the role of Pip (*Moby-Dick*), a role specially written for her by the composer Jake Heggie and which she inaugurated at the world premiere of the piece at Dallas Opera in 2010, appearing also with the original cast at San Francisco Opera and at San Diego Opera. She joined the cast of Portland Opera’s *Pirates of Penzance* as Mabel, and at New Zealand Opera appeared as Mimi (*La Boheme*).

A passionate supporter and interpreter of contemporary music, Miss Trevigne sang the world premiere of Jake Heggie’s song cycle ‘Pieces of 9/11 – Memories from Houston’ at Houston Grand Opera, and her solo CD, ‘At the Statue of Venus’ (GPR Records), written by Mr Heggie and Glen Roven—award-winning composers both—quickly climbed to the top of the US record charts.  She is featured on Jake Heggie’s latest CD release, ‘here/after, songs of lost voices’ alongside Stephen Costello, Joyce DiDonato and Nathan Gunn.

Further successes include her appearance with Albany Symphony Orchestra to perform Christopher Rouse’s masterpiece *Kabir Padavali* and a further house and role debut as Julie in Francesca Zambello’s production of *Showboat* at Washington National Opera.
