Catherine Anne Daniel, mezzo-soprano is currently based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Her upcoming projects for this season include: Debuting Jezibaba in Theater Erfurt's production of _Rusalka_, reprising the role of Erda in Calgary Opera's production of _Das Rheingold_ and ending the season singing Fricka in Edmonton Opera's _Das Rheingold_. 

Last season included recitals in Edmonton and Winnipeg, reprising the role of Katie Allen in Omar (UNC Chapel Hill and Boston Lyric) and her COC debut in the new work _Pomegranate_ by Kye Marshall. 

Earlier in 2022 Ms. Daniel sang Messiahs in Annapolis, Maryland and Regina Saskatchewan. She joined the Orchestre Classique de Montreal for two performances of _La Flambeau_ by David Bontemps. 

Catherine began graduate studies with Canadian Tenor John Tessier at the University of Alberta in the 2021-2022 season. She had two engagements with Opéra de Montréal and her Spoleto festival debut in the new work _Omar_ by Rihannon Giddens. In the summer of 2022 rejoined the Bicycle Opera project to film the acappella work _Sweat_ by Juliet Palmer. The film is set to be released in 2023. 

The 2020-2021 season was full of digital projects including: lecture recitals, opera galas, children's outreach and Against the Grain Theatre's _Messiah Complex_. 

The 2019-2020 season included engagements in Montreal and Edmonton and her Opera Tampa debut as Carmen in the opera of the same name.

The 2018-2019 season included engagements with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, singing Erda in Montreal Opera's production of _Das Rheingold_ and Emelda Griffith in Montreal Opera's production of _The Champion_.  She returned to Knoxville to sing Santuzza in Knoxville Opera's production of _Cavalleria Rusticana_. Natasha Gauthier from _Opera Canada_ writes:

"Mezzo-soprano Catherine Daniel was a force of nature as Griffith's mother, right down to her sing-song West Indian chiding. Her long, wrenching Act II solo—superbly accompanied by jazz bassist Eric Lagacé–was the opera's musical highlight, soaring, textural, guttural."

The 2017-2018 singing in the Knoxville Opera 40th season and performing with the Edmonton Symphony in their _Messiah_ concerts. Ms. Daniel sang Carmen in The Little Opera Company's production of _La Tragédie de Carmen_. This project was Ms. Tracy Dahl's directorial debut. Catherine also premiered the role of Matron Pearl in the Canadian Opera _Llandovery Castle_ in collaboration with the Bicycle Opera project.

The 2016-2017 season included singing Jezebel and the Angel in _Elijah_ with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and singing Elisabetta in Knoxville Opera's production of _Maria Stuarda_.

Ms. Daniel stepped in for the role of Klytemnestra in Edmonton Opera's production of _Elektra_ (2017). Mark Morris from Edmonton Journal wrote:

"The mezzo-soprano Catherine Daniel had an even more formidable task. As the understudy for Klytämnestra, she took over the role at fairly short notice, when Elizabeth Turnbull had to withdraw for health reasons. She pulled it off triumphantly, rather imperious in her stage presence, with a chilling range of vocal expression, colour, and often menace. Stepping in as an understudy can make a singer's reputation, and that may well be the case here."

The 2016-2017 season's engagements included singing First Maid in Opéra de Montréal's production of _Elektra_, returning to Edmonton to sing Mercedes in their production of _Carmen_ and a summer _Porgy and Bess_ tour in Germany.

In the 2015-2016 season featured Catherine singing Third Lady with Edmonton Opera's _Magic Flute_ and a European tour of _Porgy and Bess_. Ms. Daniel sang the Messiah with l'Orchestre Symphonique de Sherbrooke and participated in the Opéra de Montréal Gala. Arthur Kaptainis from the Montreal Gazette wrote:

"Mezzo-soprano Catherine Anne Daniel applied a bright, forward sound and vivacious acting style to the ode from Strauss's _Ariadne auf Naxos_."

In the summer of 2014 Catherine joined 18 other singers at the Highlands Opera Studio for a residency and performances of William Walton's _The Bear_. Ms. Daniel sang the role of Popova directed by Richard Margison and conducted by Wayne Strongman.

Catherine began 2014 singing Maria in Opéra de Montréal's production of _Porgy and Bess_.  She then returned to Edmonton to sing Kate Pinkerton in Edmonton Opera's production of _Madama Butterfly_ for their 50th anniversary season.

In 2013, Ms. Daniel released her first Album "Songs Dear to my Heart". The project is a collection of hymns and spirituals. Catherine participated in several local concerts and events in her native city, Edmonton.
