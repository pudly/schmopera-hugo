Hailed as a “superb discovery” by Operà Magazine, Canadian soprano Jessica Strong has been praised for possessing “a powerful top, a seductive vibrato and assured coloratura” (Opera Canada).  

This season Ms. Strong will return to her hometown in Winnipeg, Canada, to make her debut with Manitoba Opera as Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_.  She also joins the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra as the soprano soloist in Handel's _Messiah_. Recent highlights saw her debut the title role of Barber's _Vanessa,_ and star as Marta in Weinberg's rarely performed _Die Passagierin,_ both with Oper Frankfurt. She is thrilled to be a 2018 Research and Creation grant recipient from the Canada Council for the Arts, as well as a second time grant recipient from FACTOR (The Foundation Assisting Canadian Talent On Recording).

During the 2016/17 season, she sang with Opera Vlaanderen as Amelia in _Simon Boccanegra_, and debuted three roles with Oper Frankfurt, including Alice Ford in _Falstaff_, Lina in Verdi’s rarely performed _Stiffelio_, and Donna Anna in Mozart’s _Don Giovanni_. She was also a recipient of a 2016 Career Development Grant from the Sylva Gelber Music Foundation, and a grant from FACTOR. 

As a member of the Internationales Opernstudio of Oper Frankfurt, Ms. Strong had many successes. She made her company debut singing Amelia Grimaldi in Verdi’s _Simon Boccanegra_ and sang to rave reviews of her performance as the Prima Donna Rosa in Fioravanti’s _Le Cantatrici Villane_, where critics praised her soaring high notes, brilliant coloratura, dramatic artistry and alluring stage presence. In addition, she made her Wagnerian debut as Woglinde in both _Das Rheingold_ and _Götterdämmerung_ and Siegrune in _Die Walküre,_ appeared as one of the Sirens in the world premiere of Rolf Riehm’s _Sirenen – Bilder des Begehrens_, as Virtù/Pallade in Monteverdi’s _L’Incoronazione di Poppea_, several small roles in Puccini’s _Il Trittico_, and Elonora in Martinů’s _Tränen des Messers_.

Ms. Strong was very active in Frankfurt’s Oper für Kinder outreach program, which saw her perform in productions of _Der Fliegende Holländer_ (Senta), _Le Nozze di Figaro_ (Contessa), _Hänsel und Gretel_ (Mother), and _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_(Konstanze). During her first year in the studio, she also returned to Canada to perform recitals in Winnipeg and Southern Manitoba, and made an exciting role debut as Micaëla in Bizet’s _Carmen_ with Calgary Opera.

In 2013/14, Ms. Strong made her Canadian stage debut with Calgary Opera singing Rossini’s _L’Italiana in Algeri_, where she was praised for her “powerful, charismatic soprano” in her “stand out” performance as Elvira. A graduate of their Emerging Artist Program, Jessica performed Annina in _La Traviata_ (Violetta cover), the title role in _Il Segreto di Susanna_, and Ginevra in Handel’s _Ariodante_. Other roles include Alice Ford in _Falstaff_ and Mimi in _La Boheme_ with Calgary Opera (covers); Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_, Gretel in _Hansel and Gretel_, Frasquita in _Carmen_, Cunegonde in _Candide_, and Clarice in _Il Mondo della Luna_ at the University of Toronto; Anne Truelove in _The Rake’s Progress_ and Violetta in _La Traviata_ at the Music Academy of the West; Rosalinde in _Die Fledermaus_ with Opera NUOVA; and Helena in Britten’s _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ at the Aspen Music Festival (cover).

Ms. Strong has appeared in concert with the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, The Calgary Festival Chorus, The Aldeburgh Connection, The Musical Offering, Canzona, and at Carnegie Halls’ Zankel Hall as a participant in ‘The Song Continues’ with Marilyn Horne and Jessye Norman.
