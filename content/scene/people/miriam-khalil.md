Two time Juno nominated artist, Miriam Khalil has established herself as one of Canada’s most versatile and expressive performers. She has become increasingly known for her non traditional performances of opera, art song and concert repertoire.

She has sung on numerous opera stages across North America and the UK, including a stint at the renowned Glyndebourne Festival Opera (GFO) in the United Kingdom. Notable roles include Mimì in _La Bohème_ (Canadian Opera Company, Minnesota Opera, Opera Hamilton, Calgary Opera, Edmonton Opera and Against the Grain Theatre (AtG)); Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_ (Opera Tampa and AtG/The Banff Centre/Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival); Mélisande in _Pelléas et Mélisande_ (AtG); the Governess in The _Turn of the Screw_ (AtG); Cleopatra in _Giulio Cesare_ (GFO); Almirena in _Rinaldo_ (GFO); Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ (Pacific Opera Victoria, Opera Lyra Ottawa and AtG), Alcina (Fargo Moorhead Opera), Marzelline in _Fidelio_ (Pacific Opera Victoria) and Mamah Cheney in Hagen's _Shining Brow_ (Urban Arias) among others.

Miriam is a graduate of the prestigious Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, the Steans Institute for Young Artists (Ravinia) and the Britten-Pears Young Artist Programme in England. While in her last year of the COC Ensemble Studio, she advanced to the semi-finals of the Metropolitan Opera Council auditions and represented the Great Lakes Region on the Met stage, during which she was featured in the documentary film The Audition. She is a recipient of multiple awards and grants from the George London Foundation, the Canada Council for the Arts, Ontario Arts Council and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Audition Scholarships.

She is a proud founding member of the Dora Mavor Moore Award-winning opera company Against the Grain Theatre (AtG). With vision and dedication, AtG explores different and innovative ways of presenting opera to new and familiar audiences. Miriam is delighted to help shape “one of the most important opera companies in Canada” (Calgary Herald). She also recently joined the Voice Faculty at the University of Alberta and is very excited to be working with the next generation of singing artists and creators.

In 2019, Miriam produced and was nominated for a Juno Award for Classical Album of the Year: Vocal or Choral, for her debut album _Ayre: Live_, a song cycle by Argentinian composer Osvaldo Golijov. With this song cycle, she made her South American Debut, and premiered _Ayre_ in Buenos Aires at the Kirchner Cultural Centre. She has sung _Ayre_ to critical acclaim in Banff, Alberta, Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario, Victoria British Columbia and opened the prestigious Rockport Music Festival in the USA, making this Song Cycle her signature piece. She was elated to open the 21c Music Festival at Koerner Hall with this very piece in 2020.

Miriam made her much anticipated major role debut with the Canadian Opera Company as Mimì in _La Bohème_ in 2019. A role she revisited with Edmonton Opera last season.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Miriam pivoted masterfully to the digital stage and was involved in numerous innovative virtual projects. With Pacific Opera Victoria, she participated in their 'For All to Hear' series, where she created, directed, produced and sang an online Arabic video recital, _Songs My Parents Taught Me_. She now mentors their Apprentice Civic Engagement quartet (four young artists per year) to create, produce and direct their own virtual projects. She sang Elle in Poulenc's _La Voix Humaine_ in a unique Poulenc/Cocteau digital project with VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert to critical acclaim and sang in recital with Baritone Russel Braun and pianist Carolyn Maule, premiering a song cycle by Afarin Mansouri in the Mazzoleni Masters series at the Royal Conservatory, commissioned by Canadian Art Song Project. Miriam was also featured in Against the Grain Theatre's digital production of _Bound_, and also picked up a directing credit on their film of Holst's opera _Sāvitri_.

Her last season, was also highlighted by _Messiah/Complex_, an internationally acclaimed, ATG/Toronto Symphony realization of Handel's _Messiah_ filmed against iconic Canadian landscapes sung in six languages by twelve soloists and 4 choirs. She was nominated for her second Juno with the recent release of the _Messiah/Complex_ Album.

Coming up, Miriam is looking forward to making her debut with Vancouver Opera, Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra, Edmonton Symphony, Symphony of Northwest Arkansas, and Vancouver's Music in the Morning. She is excited to be singing repertoire that includes Leila in Bizet's _Pearl Fishers_, _Messiah_, Gorecki's Symphony of _Sorrowful Songs_, Beethoven's _9th Symphony_, Ravel's _Shéhérazade_ and more.
