Winnipeg born mezzo-soprano Laurelle Jade Froese is establishing herself as a young professional singer in Canada. She began her professional operatic debut in the spring of 2014 in Saskatoon Opera’s *Die Zauberflöte* as Second Lady, and was apart of Vancouver Opera’s Young Arist Program for the 2014-2015 season.

For Vancouver Opera, Laurelle sang Mercédès (*Carmen*) and Ida while understudying the role of Prince Orlofsky in *Die Fledermaus* this past season. Other performances include singing as alto soloist for Beethoven’s 9th Symphony with the Vancouver Oratorio Society and for Mozart’s *Requiem* with the Vancouver Bach Choir.

In the spring of 2014 Laurelle completed her Masters of Music at the University of Toronto, under the tutelage of esteemed soprano Wendy Nielsen. Performances during this time include Florence (*Albert Herring*), Giannetta (*L’elisir d’amore*) and role studies of Dorabella (*Così fan tutte*), Cherubino (*Le nozze di Figaro*) and Octavian (*Der Rosenkavalier*). Other roles include Meg Page in *Falstaff* (Opera Nuova) and Flora in *La traviata* (Highlands Opera Studio).
