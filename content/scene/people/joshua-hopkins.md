	Chosen by OPERA NEWS as one of twenty-five artists poised to break out and become a major force in the coming decade, Canadian baritone Joshua Hopkins has been hailed as "…an outstanding young baritone with a virile, vigorous yet velvety sound and an immediately evident dramatic authority."
</p>
<p>
	In the 2014-15 season Joshua makes his Lyric Opera of Chicago debut as Tadeusz in <em>The Passenger</em>conducted by Sir Andrew Davis in the acclaimed production by David Pountney. Mr. Hopkins' season also includes the title role of <em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em> at the Canadian Opera Company and Count Almaviva in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> in a return engagement with the Dallas Opera. The baritone brings his renowned portrayal of Count Almaviva to the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon for performances under the baton of Paul McCreesh. Also in concert, he joins Marin Alsop and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra as Dr. Pangloss in Bernstein's <em>Candide</em> and can be heard in Lieder recital programs with the Collaborative Arts Institute of Chicago and under the auspices of the Canadian Opera Company. Future seasons will see the baritone's return to Lyric Opera of Chicago, Canadian Opera Company, Washington National Opera, Santa Fe Opera, and Houston Grand Opera.
