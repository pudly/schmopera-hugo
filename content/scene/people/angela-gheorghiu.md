From early childhood it was obvious that she will become a singer, her destiny was the music. She attended the Music School in Bucharest and graduated the National University of Music Bucharest, where she studied with the remarkable music teacher Mia Barbu.

Angela Gheorghiu made her international debut in 1992 at Royal Opera House Covent Garden with La Bohème. In the same year she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera New York and at the Vienna State Opera. It was in the Royal Opera House Covent Garden that she first sang her much acclaimed *La Traviata* in 1994, when the BBC cleared out its schedules to broadcast the opera. At one rehearsal the conductor Sir Georg Solti said: “I was in tears. I had to go out. The girl is wonderful. She can do everything.” The performance was also filmed and recorded by Decca. Newspapers and magazines noticed that “A star is born”.

The film was released in theatres around the world and received popular and critical acclaim: “She is one of the most sensuous Toscas imaginable… Angela Gheorghiu’s passion and beauty are ideal for Tosca, as if the best qualities of Callas’ and Tebaldi’s portrayals had come together.” (Opera News, USA). Angela Gheorghiu attended the Venice Film Festival in 2001 when the movie was premiered. Ms. Gheorghiu also interpreted Juliette in the movie *Romeo et Juliette* released on DVD by Online Classics.

In 2010 she made her much-acclaimed debut in Cilea’s *Adriana Lecouvreur*, a new production of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden. The Observer wrote: “It’s hard to imagine anyone bettering Angela Gheorghiu in this part. Her voice, feather-light and creamy yet with a core of steel, matches the liquid way she moves on stage. She’s a natural actress and made the improbable death scene heartbreakingly believable and her signature aria “Poveri fiori” simply unforgettable.” 

In July 2011 she sung the title role in *Tosca* with a stellar cast led by Antonio Pappano. In September 2011 she came back to London for the revival of *Faust*, performance broadcast live in cinemas. In June 2012 Angela Gheorghiu celebrated 20 years from her debut at Royal Opera House in London performing in La Boheme.
