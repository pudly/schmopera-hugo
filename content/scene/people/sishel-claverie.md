Mexican Mezzo-soprano Sishel Claverie enjoys a versatile career in opera, musical theater, new music and multidisciplinary collaborations.

A champion of new operatic works, Ms. Claverie has been involved in a number of world premieres, including: the role of Renata in the alternate cast of HGO's Mariachi-opera **_El Milagro del Recuerdo_**, and Carmelita in Ted Rosenthal's jazz-opera **_Dear Erich_**, produced by the New York City Opera. This year, Sishel will create several roles, including: Gloria in the video-opera series **_Everything for Dawn _**by Experiments in Opera, the role of Fia in **_Pietá _**by Jake Landau, and the Cheshire Cat in the new comedic opera **_Alice_**, by Amu Scurria, produced by Music _off_ Main. She will also workshop Jorge Sosa's latest work, the monodrama **_Generación Perdida_**, in collaboration with Aural Compass Projects.

Sishel is increasingly interested in multidisciplinary collaborations. During quarantine, she helped develop an online adaptation of Verdi’s Lady Macbeth (**_Lady M_**) alongside Heartbeat Opera, experimenting with video footage and electronic sound design. Later this year, she will be featured as Lola/Carmen in the upcoming short film **_Chinese Laundry_**, directed by Giorgio Arcelli.

Sishel has recently won several awards for her work directing videos for vocal competitions, like the **_Harold Haugh Light Opera Vocal Competition_**, and the **_Opera en Castellano Competition_**, among others.

As a recent recipient of the City Artist Corps Grant, she recently presented **_Forever IN Between_**, a multimedia concert of vocal chamber music and video design, exploring the immigrant experience, presented at The Tank Theater in NYC. She is currently producing her first theatrical recital titled **_Soleful_**, to be premiered in the fall of 2022.

Sishel has sung 37 roles to date and has been seen in recital in multiple cities across the United States. Recent engagements include the role of Maria in Piazzolla’s tango-opera **_Maria de Buenos Aires_** with Opera in the Heights, Charlotte Malcolm in Sondheim’s **_A Little Night Music_** with Alamo City Opera; the title role in Heartbeat Opera’s production of **_Carmen_** in NYC, which was praised by the New York Times as “Riveting”. She performed as the Baroness and covered the Old Lady in New York City Opera’s revival of **_Candide_**, directed by Hal Prince.

Ms. Claverie has been a resident artist at the Santa Fe Opera, Utah Opera, the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme in Aldeburgh, Wolf Trap Opera, the Renata Scotto Opera Studio in Rome, and S.I.V.A.M., Mexico’s prestigious Young Artist Program.

An advocate of opera for the youth, Sishel has participated in more than ten productions specially tailored to children and teenagers, having sung nearly 500 performances.

Sishel holds a Bachelor's Degree in Music from the University of Houston and a Master's Degree in Music from Rice University. She currently resides in New York City with her husband Artie and their kitty, Stella.
