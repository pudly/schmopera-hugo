Thanks to an innate musicality and vocal versatility, soprano Erin Wall finds herself in great demand by many of the world’s leading conductors for performances on the opera and concert stages of the world. Particularly associated with the music of Mozart, Strauss and Mahler, she boasts an extensive repertoire spanning three centuries.

In the current season, Erin Wall further expands her operatic repertoire with a role debut as Elsa in Wagner’s _Lohengrin_ in a production by Katharina Wagner under conductor Josep Pons at Barcelona’s Teatro del Liceu.

Erin also met with unparalleled acclaim for her interpretation of Massenet’s _Thaïs_, which she performed in concert version under Sir Andrew Davis at both the Edinburgh International Festival and with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
