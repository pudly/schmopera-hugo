Thanks to an innate musicality and vocal versatility, soprano Erin Wall finds herself in great demand by many of the world’s leading conductors for performances on the opera and concert stages of the world. Particularly associated with the music of Mozart, Strauss and Mahler, she boasts an extensive repertoire spanning three centuries.

In the current season, Erin Wall further expands her operatic repertoire with a role debut as Elsa in Wagner’s _Lohengrin_ in a production by Katharina Wagner under conductor Josep Pons at Barcelona’s Teatro del Liceu. On the concert stage, she reprises her unanimously praised Ellen Orford in concert performances of _Peter Grimes_ with Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra under Edward Gardner in Bergen, Oslo and London; sings _Vier letzte Lieder_ with both Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin under John Wilson and Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Donald Runnicles and returns to City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra with Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla for Mahler’s Symphony No. 8 which she also joins in San Francisco marking Michael Tilson-Thomas’ closing concerts as Music Director of the SFSO.

Other operatic highlights include acclaimed debuts as Vanessa, Arabella and Daphne at Santa Fe Opera, Helena (_A Midsummer Night’s Dream_) at The Metropolitan Opera, Teatro alla Scala and Los Angeles Opera, Clémence (_L’amour de loin_) and Countess (_Le Nozze di Figaro_) at Canadian Opera Company, Desdemona (_Otello_) for Vancouver Opera, and Donna Anna (_Don Giovanni_) at The Metropolitan Opera, Wiener Staatsoper, Bayerische Staatsoper and San Francisco Opera. Erin also met with unparalleled acclaim for her interpretation of Massenet’s _Thaïs_, which she performed in concert version under Sir Andrew Davis at both the Edinburgh International Festival and with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
