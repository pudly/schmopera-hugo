A series of sensational debuts have highlighted Canadian soprano Ambur Braid as a ​‘revelation’ (Das Opernmagazin, 2022). From Eva in Schreker’s _Irrelohe_ for Opéra de Lyon to Salome in Barrie Kosky’s production for Oper Frankfurt, her sumptuous voice and enigmatic stage presence continue to leave a striking impression on audiences and critics alike.

This season, Ambur Braid makes her European debut as Tosca in Andreas Kriegenburg’s production conducted by Carlo Montanaro for Oper Frankfurt, where she is a current member of the ensemble. Elsewhere, Ambur Braid returns to the Canadian Opera Company as Salome in Atom Egoyan’s production under Johannes Debus.

Praised as an artist ​‘one would always wish for but seldom find’ (Das Opernglas), recent highlights have included Ambur Braid’s role and company debuts as both Eva in Schreker’s _Irrelohe_ for Opéra de Lyon and Stephana in Umberto Giordano’s rarely performed _Siberia_ for the Bregenzer Festspiele. In Frankfurt Ambur Braid has recently given her first performances as Norma conducted by Erik Nielsen, as well as Ariadne (_Ariadne auf Naxos_) under Thomas Guggeis. Recent concert highlights have included Schmitt’s _La Tragédie de Salomé_with Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra under Alain Altinoglu and Beethoven’s Symphony No.9 with National Arts Centre Orchestra, Ottawa.

Ambur Braid has received degrees from the Glenn Gould School of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto and San Francisco Conservatory and is a studio alumna and former ensemble member of the Canadian Opera Company.
