The Austrian Baritone Adrian Eröd is a great favorite of public and press at his base, the Vienna State Opera, with his tremendous diversity, whether as Figaro in Rossini’s _Barber of Seville_, as Valentin in Gounod’s _Faust_, as Britten’s _Billy Budd_ or as Lescaut in Massenet’s _Manon_.

His magnificent success with Christian Thielemann as Sixtus Beckmesser in Wagner’s _Meistersinger von Nürnberg_ led to an invitation to sing the role at the Bayreuth Festival. Since that time he sang the role of Beckmesser also in Zurich, Cologne, Leipzig, Tokyo and Amsterdam, he will perform it again at the Salzburg Easter Festival in 2019. 

His performance of Loge in the Vienna State Opera production of Wagner’s Das Rheingold had attracted international attention and his creation of the role of Shylock in the World Premiere of André Tchaikovsky’s _The Merchant of Venice_ at the Bregenz Festival was highly acclaimed.

Since his debut 2001 at the Vienna State Opera as Mercutio in Gounod’s _Roméo et Juliette_, Adrian Eröd has been cast in such roles as Guglielmo, Conte Almaviva, Eisenstein, Albert (_Werther_), Olivier (_Capriccio_) as well as Prospero in the Austrian premiere of Thomas Adès’ _The Tempest_. The leading male role of Jason in Aribert Reimann’s _Medea_ was written for him and he performed the world premiere. 

He has also appeared at the Semperoper Dresden, the Teatro alla Scala Milano and the Teatro Fenice in Venice, at the Paris Opera, the Houston Grand Opera and the Chicago Lyric Opera, the Hamburg State Opera, the Oper Frankfurt and the New National Opera Tokyo. 

Following his education at the Universität für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Vienna, where he was a student of Walter Berry, Adrian Eröd was engaged at the Landestheater Linz, then Wiener Volksoper and finally the Vienna State Opera, which, alongside his forthcoming international engagements, will continue to be a central base in his artistic future. 

Parallel to his opera career, Adrian Eröd is also extremely successful on the concert stage. He has appeared with Riccardo Muti and Nikolaus Harnoncourt with the Vienna Philharmonic, with Sir Simon Rattle and Christian Thielemann at the Berlin Philharmonic, he performed Orff’s _Carmina Burana_ with Fabio Luisi and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, Bach’s _St. John’s Passion_ with Philippe Jordan as well as his _St. Matthew’s Passion_ and Brahms’ _German Requiem_ with Helmut Rilling, Fauré’s _Requiem_ with Myung-Whun Chung and he sang Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_ with the Berlin Radio Orchestra and Marek Janowski.

He has also appeared at the Suntory Hall Tokyo, the Concertgebouw Amsterdam, the Philharmonie Berlin, The Gewandhaus Leipzig, the Auditorio Nacional Madrid, the Vienna Musikverein and Konzerthaus, the Lucerne Festival, the Salzburg Easter Festival and Mozartwoche, the Styriarte Graz and the Beethoven Festival in Bonn. He has worked with Maximilian Schell, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Uri Caine, Ingo Metzmacher, Christoph Eschenbach, Ulf Schirmer, Thomas Hengelbrock, Vladimir Fedoseev and the ensemble modern.

He is particularly fond of Lied, and has given recitals in the Vienna and the Graz Musikverein, the Brucknerhaus in Linz, the Lisztzentrum Raiding, the Tokyo Spring Festival and the Carinthian Summer, establishing a close collaborative relationship with the pianist Helmut Deutsch. 

He recorded Songs of Franz Liszt as well as Schubert’s _Winterreise_, and recently a CD with romantic duets together with his wife Monica Theiss-Eröd.
