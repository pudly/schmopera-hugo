Canadian soprano **Jacqueline Woodley** has been praised for her fearless versatility, changing styles fluidly from early music to contemporary, from opera to art song. Sought after for her “exceptional talent” in performing modern works, Jacqueline created the role of Milice-Bride in the première of Ana Sokolovic’s opera _Svaba-Wedding_ with Queen of Puddings Music Theatre. This production toured Europe and Canada and Ms. Woodley was also chosen for the San Francisco and Philadelphia premieres of this remarkable work. Most recently, she was hailed for her searing performance as Natalia in the world premiere of _Oksana G_ for Tapestry New Opera and earlier appeared in the premiere of that company’s production of _M’Dea Undone_ which won a Dora award. Other acclaimed performances of contemporary music include works by György Kurtág, Kaija Saariaho, and Judith Weir.

Upcoming for 2022/2023, Ms. Woodley appears as the soprano soloist with the Grand Philharmonic Choir for Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_, Arion Baroque for a series of Bach cantatas, the Brahms’ _Requiem_ with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and Handel’s _Brockes Passion_ with Metropolitan United (Toronto). She also looks forward to returning to Pacific Opera Victoria as Zaunschlüpfer in Braunfels’ _Die Vögel_.

Jacqueline’s 2021/2022 included a celebrated performance as Valencienne in Calgary Opera’s production of Lehar’s _The Merry Widow_. In December, Jacqueline was the soprano soloist for Orchestre Classique de Montréal’s _Messiah_ and _Choral Fantasty_ of Beethoven.

During the 2019-2020 season she moved back to the baroque world for the works of Bach, Handel and Charpentier for concerts with The Florida Orchestra, Regina Symphony, Clavecins en concert, Chorus Niagara and the Ottawa Choral Society. As well, she sang the 2019 _Messiah_ for the Edmonton Symphony. In Victoria, Pacific Opera Victoria patrons heard her as Tina in Dove’s _Flight_.

Her recent seasons have included Papagena (_Die Zauberflöte),_ Cherubino (_Marriage of Figaro_), and The Forest Bird (_Siegfried_) for the Canadian Opera Company, _Messiah_ with the Grand Philharmonic Choir and Symphony Nova Scotia, Mozart’s _Exsultate, Jubilate_ with the Edmonton Symphony, _Daphne et Apollo_ and _Dido and Aeneas_ for Toronto Masque Theatre, and Tapestry’s ‘Lib-Lab’.

Other highlights include her Montreal Symphony debut under Kent Nagano, the role of Adele (_Die Fledermaus_) for Edmonton Opera, appearances at the Vancouver Early Music Festival and the Ottawa Chamberfest with Les Voix Baroques; a soprano and trumpet programme for Clavecin en Concert and La Fête de la Musique de Mont-Tremblant; and Handel’s _Messiah_ for groups such as the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Aradia Ensemble, and in a staged version for Against the Grain Theatre.

An alumna of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, she performed and covered several main stage roles, among which were Olympia (_Les_ _Contes d’Hoffmann_), Amore (_Orfeo ed Euridice_), First Priestess (_Iphigénie en Tauride_), Lace Seller (_Death in Venice_), and Iris (_Semele)._

Possessing a strong affinity for concert works, Jacqueline’s repertoire includes Bach’s _Saint John Passion_, Orff’s _Carmina Burana_, the Fauré and Mozart’s _Requiem_s, Mahler’s _Symphony No. VIII_, Mercure’s _Cantate pour une joie_, Haydn’s _Creation_, Pärt’s _Stabat Mater_, Villa-Lobos’ _Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, I-II_, and Vaughan Williams’ _Dona Nobis Pacem._

In addition to being an active coach in her home studio and conducting an amateur women’s chamber choir, Jacqueline was recently at Opera Nuova as part of their 20th Anniversary Alumni Mentorship Program, where she taught lessons, gave masterclasses, and performed in the gala. Ms. Woodley has recorded works by Canadian composer Norbert Palej for the Canadian Art Song Project, and recently released albums of the music of Québecois composer Lionel Daunais ([_Mélodies,_](https://lioneldaunais.com/) 2022), and Iranian-Canadian composer Parisa Sabet ([_A Cup of Sins_](https://redshiftmusicsociety.bandcamp.com/album/a-cup-of-sins), 2022).
