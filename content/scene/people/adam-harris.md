Canadian baritone Adam Harris has been described as an intuitively musical and distinctively dramatic young artist. Completing his BMus in vocal performance from Western University, he is currently pursuing a master's degree in opera performance at the University of Toronto studying with Laura Tucker.

Recent performances include Marcello in *La Bohème*, Masetto in *Don Giovanni*, Ben Benny in *Paul Bunyan*, Mr Gobineau in *The Medium*, Al in *City Workers In Love* and Figaro in *Le Nozze di Figaro*. Adam can next be seen singing the role of Pluto, God of the Underworld, in UofT Opera's *Orphèe aux Enfers*.
    
Adam has recently performed the baritone solo in *Carmina Burana* with the Indian River Festival, and will be performing George Butterworth's *Six Songs from a Shropshire Lad* alongside the UTSO with conductor Uri Mayer.
