Alberta‐born soprano Caitlin Wood was “absolutely vibrant” and showed “great comic flair” in her debut as Susanna in Vancouver Opera Festival’s _The Marriage of Figar_o. Caitlin portrayed Ava in City Opera Vancouver’s 2017 world premiere of Marie Clements/Brian Current’s powerful opera _Missing_, showing “exquisite vulnerability”.

Caitlin begins this season in Pacific Opera Victoria’s _Il Trittico_ and reprises the role of Ava in the company’s touring production of Missing.

Upcoming performances for Caitlin include Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and Cunegonde in Bernstein’s _Candide_, both with Edmonton Opera, as well as “Topsy‐Turvy”, a concert of Gilbert and Sullivan favourites with Chorus Niagara and Niagara Symphony.

Mark Morris called Caitlin’s recent Comtesse Adele “the standout performance of the evening” in Edmonton Opera’s _Le Comte Ory_, and as Adele in Toronto Operetta Theatre’s _Die Fledermaus_, Paula Citron praised her “charming stage presence”. Recent concert performances for Caitlin include Vancouver Bach Choir/Vancouver Opera Festival’s premiere of Brian Current’s _The River of Light_, _Carmina Burana_ with Ottawa Choral Society, and Mozart’s _Requiem_ with Windsor Symphony Orchestra.

Caitlin received her Masters of Music in Opera Performance from University of Toronto, and gained attention as Joanna in _Sweeney Todd_ while a member of Vancouver Opera’s Yulanda M. Faris Young Artist Program."
