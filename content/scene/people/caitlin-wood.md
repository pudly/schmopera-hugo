Alberta-born soprano Caitlin Wood was "absolutely vibrant" and showed "great comic flair" in her debut as Susanna in Vancouver Opera Festival's _The Marriage of Figaro_. Caitlin portrayed Ava in City Opera Vancouver's 2017 world premiere of Marie Clements/Brian Current's powerful opera _Missing_, showing "exquisite vulnerability".

Mark Morris called Caitlin's recent Comtesse Adele "the standout performance of the evening" in _Le Comte Ory_ at Edmonton Opera. As Susanna in their 2020 production of _Marriage of Figaro_, Caitlin was hailed as "an exceptional soprano with excellent comedy".

In 2022, Caitlin portrayed  the Housewife in the multi-Dora Award nominated world premiere of _Gould's Wall_ (Current/Balkan) with Tapestry Opera and was a sparkling Despina in Edmonton Opera's _Cosi fan tutte_. As Josephine in _HMS Pinafore_ with Vancouver Opera, Janet Smith observed: "Capturing the full range of emotions of her character, Caitlin Wood has a vibrant soprano voice that easily scales the heights of Josephine's arias." Caitlin debuts with Opera Kelowna in their production of _Cosi fan tutte_, in 2023.

Recent concert performances for Caitlin include Vancouver Bach Choir/Vancouver Opera Festival's premiere of Brian Current's _The River of Light_, _Carmina Burana_ with Ottawa Choral Society, and Mozart's _Requiem_ with Windsor Symphony Orchestra. In 2023, Caitlin joins Windsor Symphony for _Messiah_ highlights.

Caitlin is featured in several OperaBreaks, cinematic videos produced by Domoney Artists Management, and voiced Iona the cockatiel in Opera 5's charming animated video, _Threepenny Submarine_, in collaboration with Kingston Symphony.
