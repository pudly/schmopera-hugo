Lauren Lodge-Campbell is a British/Australian soprano, studying on the Artist Masters course at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama with Janice Chapman and Yvonne Kenny. Lauren completed a BMus (Advanced Performance, 1st class) at the Queensland Conservatorium (Australia) in 2013, where she studied with Margaret Schindler. Awards while at the Conservatorium include the Linda Edith Allen Award for Singing (Postgraduate), the Ethel Osborn Scholarship, the Doreen Ord & Lyceum Club Prize, and both the Undergraduate and Postgraduate Elizabeth Muir Awards for Singing. 

At the Guildhall School Lauren was the winner of the Susan Longfield Prize and the Franz Schubert Institut Lieder Competition. The latter awarded her a full scholarship to study at the Franz Schubert Institut in Baden, Austria in summer 2016. In 2017 Lauren was the winner of the inaugural Cheltenham Bach Choir Competition.

Opera roles include the title role in Janáček’s *The Cunning Little Vixen*, for which she was recipient of the Sir Mostyn Hanger Opera Prize; Drusilla *L’incoronazione di Poppea*, Cherubino *Le nozze di Figaro*, A Woman (The Plaint) *The Fairy Queen*, and Lauretta *Gianni Schicchi*. Lauren performed the lead role of Matsya in the world premiere of the touring opera *Floods* for the Queensland Conservatorium and Brisbane Festival. In 2016 Lauren made her Barbican Hall debut with the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Simon Rattle in the role of the Princess in the world premiere of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies’ children’s opera *The Hogboon*, a role which Opera Magazine described as “given with touching simplicity and luminous vocal beauty”.

A keen recitalist, Lauren has performed at recitals at the Barbican Hall, LSO St Luke’s and at the Holywell Music Room as part of the Oxford Lieder Festival Mastercourse. Lauren performed Schumann’s *Spanisches Liebeslieder* at Wigmore Hall alongside the Prince Consort and Guildhall musicians. A member of the Guildhall Song Guild directed by Graham Johnson OBE, Lauren has participated in masterclasses with such artists as Roger Vignoles, Julius Drake, Elly Ameling, Richard Stokes, Dame Emma Kirkby and Dame Felicity Lott. Lauren has performed as a soloist with the Queensland Conservatorium Chamber Orchestra and is a member of the Guildhall Consort, most recently performing with the Venice Baroque Orchestra at the Barbican Hall.

Lauren is grateful for the generous support from the Carpenters' Company (Henry Osborne Award), the Australia Day Foundation UK Trust, the Kathleen Trust and the Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University.
