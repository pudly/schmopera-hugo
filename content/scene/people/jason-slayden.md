Tenor	 Jason	 Slayden has	 been	 celebrated	 for	 the	 warmth	 and	 beauty	 of	 his	 voice,	 as	 well	 as	 demonstrating	 “considerable	subtlety	 as	 an	 actor”. The	 2016-2017	 season included Gabriele	Adorno	in	*Simon	Boccanegra*	with	Pacific	Opera	Victoria,	Pinkerton	in	* Madama	 Butterfly*	 with	 Annapolis	 Opera,	 Jimmy	 Ogle in	 *Later	the	 Same	 Evening* with	 Opera	 Memphis,	 and Christian	 in	 *Cyrano*	with Michigan	Opera	Theatre. The	2017-2018	season	sees	him	as Ruggero	in	*La	rondine*	with	Opera	San	Jose	and	his return	to	Pacific	
Opera	Victoria as	Rodolfo	in	*La	bohème*.

In	the	2014-2015	season,	he	debuted with	Gotham	Chamber	Opera	in	their	double	bill	of	Bohuslav	Martinů’s	*Alexandre	Bis* and	*Veselohra	na	Mostĕ*	(*Comedy	on	the	Bridge*),	returned	to	Arizona	Opera	to	as	the	Duke	in	Verdi’s	*Rigoletto* and	 the	Jacksonville	 Symphony	 for	 Handel’s	*Messiah*, and	made	 debuts	 with	 Florida	Grand	Opera	 as	 Ferrando	 in

His	“Ingemisco	teamquam	reus”	beautifully	forged	power	with	lyricism.”

The	 2012-13	 season	 marked	 Jason’s	 international	 debut,	 which	 attracted	 much	 critical	 acclaim.	 As	 Rodolfo	 in	 Vancouver	Opera’s	*La	bohème*,	critics	praised	him	as	a	“heartfelt,	note-perfect	tenor,”	and	said,	“His	‘Che	gelida	manina’	was	refreshingly	realistic...and	was	dramatically	as	well	as	musically	interesting.”	Prior	to	that	he	was	a Filene	Young	Artist	with	Wolf	Trap	Opera,	where	he	performed	Don	Ottavio	in	*Don	Giovanni*,	a	recital	with	pianist	Steven Blier,	and	the	tenor	solo	in	Beethoven’s	Ninth	 Symphony	 with	 the	 National	 Symphony	 Orchestra.
