Bevan begins the 2016/17 season by returning to the English National Opera as Zerlina in Richard Jones’ new production of Mozart *Don Giovanni*, under Mark Wigglesworth. She will also headline a tour of Asia with Harry Bicket and The English Concert, as part of the Shakespeare 400 celebrations, and sing Bach with the Academy of Ancient Music and Gabrieli Consort. Bevan makes her role debut as Merab in Barrie Kosky’s production of Handel *Saul* this season for the Adelaide Festival, and will perform Richard Ayres’ *In the Alps* with Nicholas Collon and the Aurora Orchestra. In recital she will appear with the Myrthen Ensemble at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Musée d’Orsay, and Wigmore Hall, and will also record a solo album with accompanist Joseph Middleton for Signum.
