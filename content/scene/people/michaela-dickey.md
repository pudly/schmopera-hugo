Mezzo-soprano Michaela Dickey, from 100 Mile House BC, holds both a Masters of Music and Artist Diploma in Voice and Opera Performance at McGill University, a Bachelor of Music in Opera Performance at the University of British Columbia and Diplomas in Voice Performance and Teaching from the Victoria Conservatory of Music. Over the years, Michaela has had the unique opportunity to work with incredible Canadian and American artists and grow and develop her art at some of the most esteemed institutions and summer programs in Canada.

Most recently, Michaela celebrated the end of her studies at McGill with a final recital in collaboration with Marie-Eve Scarfone, and had the pleasure of performing the role of Cherubino in Opera McGill’s mainstage production of *Le Nozze di Figaro*.

This past summer, Michaela performed the role of Zerlina in *#UncleJohn*, a modern interpretation of Mozart’s *Don Giovanni* at the Banff Centre, in a collaboration between Against the Grain Theatre and the Canadian Opera Company. She has appeared as a soloist with TEM under the direction of Canadian countertenor Daniel Taylor and with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra Pops under the baton of Maestro Bramwell Tovey.

During her time at McGill, Michaela has performed various roles with Opera McGill. She appeared as Hermia in Benjamin Britten’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, Tolomeo in Handel’s *Cesare in Egitto*, Goffredo in Handel’s *Rinaldo* and Prison Matron in the Canadian Premiere of John Musto’s *Volpone*. She also performed the role of Nutrice in Claudio Monteverdi’s *L’Incoronazione di Poppea* and Mrs. Grose in Benjamin Britten’s *Turn of the Screw*. Other operatic credits include Cherubino in Mozart’s *Le Nozze di Figaro* and Béatrice in Hector Berlioz’s opera *Béatrice et Bénédict* with Opera NUOVA in the Vocal Arts Festival; as well as Hansel in Humperdinck’s *Hansel and Gretel*, Dorothée in Jules Massenet’s *Cendrillon* and Sorella Infermiera in Puccini’s *Suor Angelica* with the UBC Opera Ensemble.

While in Victoria, Michaela had the opportunity to perform the role of Nikki in the Pacific Opera of Victoria Young Artist Program’s 2008 production of James Rolfe’s *Elijah’s Kite* – a contemporary Canadian opera for the schools addressing issues with bullying.

Michaela has appeared as a soloist in excerpts for various Opera McGill and UBC Opera Ensemble events and has also appeared as a chorus member in several productions with Opera McGill, UBC Opera Ensemble, and also with Pacific Opera of Victoria in the Canadian premiere of Blitzstein’s *Regina*.  She has performed solo works and recitals in German, French, English and Spanish in recital and concert in collaboration with Richard Coburn, Patrick Hansen, Robert Holliston, Julien Leblanc, Alex Soloway and Marie-Ève Scarfone.
