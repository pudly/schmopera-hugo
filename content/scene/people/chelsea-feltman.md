Praised for her “magnetic” stage presence (NY Classical Review), “warm, golden voice” (Classical.Music.NYC), and “glossy high register” (Sundsvalls Tidning), soprano Chelsea Feltman is a dynamic performer whose repertoire spans from the baroque to contemporary periods, including musical theater and the American songbook. She has studied and performed at Tanglewood, Académie International d’Eté in Nice, La Lingua Della Lirica in Novafeltria, Italy, as Gretel in San Jose, Costa Rica, and as Gilda, Lucia, and Blondchen in concert at the Härnösand Summer Opera Festival in Sweden, where she has been a member of the resident ensemble since 2014.

Chelsea is an alumna of The Juilliard School, where she completed her undergraduate studies with Edith Bers, and Mannes College of Music, where she received her master’s degree and was a member of the Mannes Opera Program for two years, studying with Ruth Falcon and Beth Roberts. Performance credits include the roles of Tytania in Britten's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, Second Woman in Purcell's *Dido and Aeneas* (both with the Juilliard Opera Workshop), Zerlina in *Don Giovanni*, and Lucia in *The Rape of Lucretia* under the baton of Joseph Colaneri (both with Mannes Opera), Frasquita in *Carmen* and Monica in Menotti’s *The Medium* (The Secret Opera), and Puck in Gramercy Opera’s adaptation of Purcell’s *The Fairy Queen*. An avid performer of new music, she has sung the works of Del Tredici with Mo. Lowell Liebermann and the Mannes American Composers Ensemble, performed the New York premiere of Melissa Dunphy’s *Tesla’s Pigeon* with The Secret Opera, and appeared in the world premiere of Daniel Felsenfeld’s *The Inner Circle* at The Brick Theater. Chelsea has also appeared as soprano soloist in Handel’s *Messiah* with the Metro Chamber Orchestra and as a soloist in Charpentier’s cantata *In Nativitatem Domini Canticum*. She appears in an upcoming documentary focusing on David Del Tredici, both as a soloist and in conversation with the composer himself.
