Lauded by Opera News for his “inky bass-baritone and clear projection seemed ideally suited to the role, capturing this isolated man's passion with telling grief,” Alfred Walker returns to San Francisco Opera for Orest in *Elektra*, and to the Metropolitan Opera for Titurel in *Parisfal* and the Speaker in *The Magic Flute* in the 2017-18 season. He also joins Seattle Opera for Amonasro in *Aida* and Porgy in *Porgy and Bess*, and Portland Opera for Méphistophélès in *Faust*. Concert performances include excerpts from *Parsifal* with the Baltimore Symphony, Verdi’s *Requiem* with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Orchestra Now.

He also sang Porgy in *Porgy and Bess* in his debut with the Sydney Symphony, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Phoenix Symphony. 

The bass-baritone recently triumphed as the title role in *Der fliegende Holländer* at Theater Basel and returned to the company for his first performances of both Amfortas in *Parsifal* and Amonasro in *Aida*.

He sang Telramund in concert performances of *Lohengrin* in Oviedo, Spain under the baton of Semyon Bychkov and later joined the conductor and the WDR Sinfonie Orchester Köln for Lodovico in *Otello*.
