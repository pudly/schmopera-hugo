Lauded by Opera News for his “inky bass-baritone and clear projection seemed ideally suited to the role, capturing this isolated man's passion with telling grief,” Alfred Walker returns to San Francisco Opera for Orest in *Elektra*, and to the Metropolitan Opera for Titurel in *Parisfal* and the Speaker in *The Magic Flute* in the 2017-18 season. He also joins Seattle Opera for Amonasro in *Aida* and Porgy in *Porgy and Bess*, and Portland Opera for Méphistophélès in *Faust*. Concert performances include excerpts from *Parsifal* with the Baltimore Symphony, Verdi’s *Requiem* with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Orchestra Now. Last season he sang his first performances of Wotan in *Das Rheingold* with North Carolina Opera and Méphistophélès in Berlioz’s *La damnation du Faust* at the Teatro Municipal de Santiago as well as created the title role of Josh Gibson in the world premiere of Sonenberg’s *The Player King* with Pittsburgh Opera. He also sang Porgy in *Porgy and Bess* in his debut with the Sydney Symphony, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Phoenix Symphony. 

The bass-baritone recently triumphed as the title role in *Der fliegende Holländer* at Theater Basel and returned to the company for his first performances of both Amfortas in *Parsifal* and Amonasro in *Aida*.

His celebrated characterization of Orest in *Elektra* has been seen at Teatro alla Scala, Seattle Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin, and Spain’s San Sebastián Festival and he received great acclaim for performances of Allazim in the Peter Sellars’ production of *Zaide* at the Festival d’Aix-en-Provence, Wiener Festwochen, London’s Barbican Center, and Lincoln Center’s Mostly Mozart Festival. He sang Telramund in concert performances of *Lohengrin* in Oviedo, Spain under the baton of Semyon Bychkov and later joined the conductor and the WDR Sinfonie Orchester Köln for Lodovico in *Otello*. In lesser-known repertoire, he sang Kunrad in *Feuersnot* with the American Symphony Orchestra and König Karl in Schubert’s *Fierrabras* at the Bard Music Festival.
