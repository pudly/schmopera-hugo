As the Associated Press observes, Stephen Costello is “a prodigiously gifted singer whose voice makes an immediate impact.” The Philadelphia-born tenor quickly established a reputation as a “first-class talent” (Opera News) after coming to national attention in 2007, when, aged 26, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut on the company’s season-opening night. Two years later Costello won the prestigious Richard Tucker Award, and has since appeared at many of the world’s most important opera houses and music festivals, including the Metropolitan Opera New York; Royal Opera House Covent Garden; Deutsche Oper Berlin; Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin; Vienna State Opera; Bayerische Staatsoper Munich and the Salzburg Festival. 

In 2010 Costello created the role of Greenhorn (Ishmael) in the Dallas Opera’s world-premiere production of Jake Heggie and Gene Scheer’s *Moby-Dick*, prompting Opera magazine to hail him as “a tenor of ineffable sensitivity, with unfailing elegance in singing and a disconcerting ease in producing notes in head-voice.” Costello has since revised this role at San Francisco opera and Washington National Opera. Engagements in the 14-15 season and beyond include his return to the Metropolitan Opera, Covent Garden, Vienna State Opera, Canadian Opera Company, Houston Grand Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin and Teatro Real Madrid.
