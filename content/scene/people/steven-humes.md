An operatic performer, passionate music educator, and instinctive conductor, Steven Humes has already experienced a diverse musical career.  

As the title role in Benjamin Britten's *Albert Herring* and 'Father Confessor in Poulenc's *Dialogue of the Carmelites*, Steven’s versatility on stage belies his young age.  His performing endeavors have led him to work with the likes of Stephen Carr, Stephen Daigle, Brian DeMaris and David Lefkowich.  He holds numerous performance awards including First Prize at the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) Competition.  

Off stage, Steven finds joy in fostering a love for music in young lives.  As Director of Children’s and Youth Music at First Presbyterian Church in Ithaca, New York, Steven discovered in his students a refreshing excitement for music.  Such enthusiasm led to new opportunities including the creation of a fifteen member youth orchestra.  

Steven is also a young and talented choral conductor.  His sensitivity and leadership led him to become a Semi-Finalist in the ACDA National Student Conducting Competition this past March.  Steven has studied conducting with Dr. Janet Galván and Professor Lawrence Doebler.  

Steven has also had the opportunity to enhance his performance studies over recent summers.  In 2011 and 2014, Steven studied both Italian opera and language at Si Parla, Si Canta, a program led by Benton Hess of the Eastman School of Music.  While attending Si Parla, Si Canta, Steven lived in Urbania, Italy and studied at the highly acclaimed language school, Centro Studi Italiani.  This past summer, Steven was a Fellow at The CoOPERAtive Program in Princeton, NJ.  There, he had the opportunity to work closely with Gina Lapinski of the Metropolitan Opera and Eric Weimer from Lyric Opera of Chicago.  

Steven holds degrees in both Vocal Performance and Music Education from Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY.  Currently, Steven is pursuing his M.M. in Voice Performance & Literature at the Eastman School of Music and is a student of Professor Robert Swensen.
