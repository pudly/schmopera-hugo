Canadian, mezzo Soprano Lucia Cervoni has been described by Canada’s leading national paper *The Globe and Mail* as “Tall and statuesque, she has a voice on the darker side, and blessed with this natural color, she has a distinctive sound that should take her far.” 

Lucia Cervoni has been hailed by critiques around the globe as possessing a voice and presence, “beautifully rich and glamourously beautiful to behold.” 
Lucia Cervoni starts her exciting 2014/2015 season with Theater Magdeburg debuting the role of Dorabella in Mozart’s *Cosi fan tutte*. As she continues into the season she revisits the roles of Die Dritte Dame in *Die Zauberflöte* and Cherubino in *Le Nozze di Figaro*. A highlight in the season comes in the spring with her role debut of Donna Isabella in Fibich’s *The Bride of Messina*. 

In Cervoni’s 2013/2104 season she had much success debuting the role of Octavian in Strauss’ *Der Rosenkavalier*, while along side the roles of Hänsel in Humperdinck’s *Hänsel und Gretel* and Cherubino in Mozart’s *Le Nozze di Figaro*. Internationally she returned to the concert stage singing with The Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra as the Mezzo Soloist in Handel’s *The Messiah* and making her Asian debut with The Singapore Symphony Orchestra singing Bach’s *St. John Passion*. She was also thrilled to sing her first Verdi’s *Requiem* with the Magdeburger Kantatenchor. 

Lucia Cervoni ignited her 2012/2013 season with Theater Magdeburg with her role debut as Eboli in Verdi’s *Don Carlo*. As she continued into the season, she revisited the roles of Suzuki in *Madame Butterfly*, Niklas/Muse in *Hoffman’s Erzählungen* and Hermia in a new premiere of Britten’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*. Reviewed by the press as a singer with a dark velvety voice from whom you should never take your eyes for fear of missing something, Cervoni had her first ever one woman show of Henze’s *El Rey de Harlem*. 

In Lucia Cervoni's 2011/12 season with Theater Magdeburg, she debuted the roles of Niklas/Muse in Offenbach’s *Hoffmans Erzählungen*, and Tisbe in Rossini’s *La Cenerentola*. She rediscovered the roles of Suzuki in Puccini’s *Madame Butterfly* and Charlotte in Massenet’s *Werther*. In the fall of 2011 Cervoni returned to The Santa Fe Symphony as the Mezzo Soloist in Handel’s *The Messiah*. Cervoni concluded her 2011/2012 season with two German opera house debuts as Suzuki in *Madame Butterfly* at the Staatstheater Schwerin and at Theater Freiberg as Charlotte in *Werther*, and in the summer of 2012, Cervoni sang in two opera galas collaborating with the Bayerisches Kammerorchester Bad Brückenau and with Ton:arten in Sasbachwalden. 

In previous season with Theater Magdeburg she was heard as Charlotte in *Werther*, Carmen in Bizet’s *Carmen*, Dritte Dame in Mozart's *Die Zauberflöte*, Diana in Offenbach's *Orpheus in der Unterwelt* and Mrs. Grose in Britten's *The Turn of the Screw*. In Cervoni's 2009/10 season with Theater Magadeburg she debuted as Carmen in Bizet’s *Carmen*, Diana in Offenbach’s *Orpheus in der Unterwelt*, Zita in Puccini’s much loved comedy *Gianni Schicchi* and returned to the role of Dritte Dame in Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte*. In Ms. Cervoni’s 2008/09 she was heard as Maddalena in Verdi’s *Rigoletto*, Sonjetka in Shostakovich’s *Lady Macbeth von Mzensk*, Zweite Dame in Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte*, Schenkwirtin/Amme in Musorgsky’s *Boris Gudonow*, a Recital Soloist in a Chamber Concert Series and in Tobias Wellemeyer’s scenic evening of "Love Songs".

Earlier in 2008 Lucia Cervoni debuted with Glimmerglass Opera as Cornelia in Handel’s *Giulio Cesare*. Gay City News wrote, “Leading the supporting cast were Canadian mezzo-soprano Lucia Cervoni as the widowed Cornelia…. lovely to listen to, with a contralto colored tone that never became lugubrious but also was glamorously beautiful to behold, making the widow of Pompey a totally convincing object of Achilla's and Tolomeo's lust.” Cervoni appeared as Suky Tawdry in *The Beggar’s Opera* at the Châteauville Foundation, conducted by Lorin Maazel. Concert engagements included Handel’s *Messiah* with the South Carolina Philharmonic and as the Mezzo Soprano Soloist in Mozart’s *Missa Solemnis* with the Santa Fe Symphony. Lucia Cervoni returned to the Santa Fe Symphony later in the fall of 2008 as a Soloist in Handel’s *Messiah*.

In previous seasons Lucia’s engagements included a debut with The Santa Fe Opera, as Dritte Dame in a “well-matched trio who sang and acted well” of Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte*. She then returned to the company to premiere the role of Tessa, for their Spring Tour, in a new production, *The Trinity*, by American composer John Kennedy. The New Mexican declared that Cervoni “brought a rich mezzo-soprano and warm sympathy” to the role.

As a member of Seattle Opera’s Young Artist Program, Lucia performed the roles of Mrs. Grose in Britten’s *The Turn of the Screw* and *Carmen*, “quite captivating with her dark eyes and impressive command of many subtleties” in Peter Brooks’ *The Tragedy of Carmen*. In Cervoni's 2009-2010 season she was the recipient of the prestigious Förderpreis für junge Künstler (prize for young artist) from the Förderverein Theater Magdeburg. In 2007 Ms. Cervoni was a prize winner at The Washington International Competition. Cervoni was a Scholarship recipient as well a winner of the Hugh Ross Award at The Manhattan School of Music and a receiver of the Anna Case Mackay Grant from the Santa Fe Opera. She is also a recipient of numerous Grants from The Canada Council of the Arts.
