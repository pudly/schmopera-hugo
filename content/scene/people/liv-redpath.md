Soprano Liv Redpath just finished her first year as a Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist at LA Opera, where she sang Olympia in *Les contes d'Hoffmann*, covered Konstanze and Blonde in *Die Entführung aus dem Serail*, and collaborated with Matthew Aucoin on a number of projects, including *Nosferatu* at the Ace Hotel, an After Hours concert of Britten Folk Songs and Joni Mitchell, and a wide ranging Mozart tour throughout the city. She will return to LA next season to sing Amour in *Orphée et Eurydice*, Frasquita in *Carmen*, and Countess Ceprano in *Rigoletto*. Liv will also cover Cunégonde in *Candide* and Gilda in *Rigoletto*. She will spend the summer at Santa Fe Opera as an Apprentice Singer, covering the Queen of Shemakha in *The Golden Cockerel*.

Prior to her time in LA, Liv earned her Master of Music at The Juilliard School as a proud recipient of a Kovner Fellowship. Roles at Juilliard included Thérèse in *Les mamelles de Tirésias*, Königin der Nacht in *Die Zauberflöte*, Barbarina in *Le nozze di Figaro*, and Diane in *Iphigénie en Aulide* with MET + Juilliard. Liv was also invited to sing Sophie in *Der Rosenkavalier* for the scenes workshop with James Levine and the Met Orchestra at the end of last year's Lindemann Young Artists season. In the summer of 2016, she sang Echo in *Ariadne on Naxos* with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis and Héro in *Béatrice et Bénédict* with Aspen Opera Theater Center. 

Liv completed her studies in English at Harvard College, where she sang with various companies in Boston and received the Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts upon graduation. As a student, she sang Cunégonde in *Candide*, Tytania in *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, Susanna in *Le nozze di Figaro*, Adele in *Die Fledermaus*, La Fée in *Cendrillon*, Belinda in *Dido and Aeneas*, and the title role in *Lakmé*. In addition to these roles sung, Liv has covered Fiorilla in *Il turco in Italia*, Lisette in *La rondine*, Cleopatra in *Giulio Cesare*, India in *Shalimar the Clown*, and the title roles in *Iphigénie en Aulide* and *Snegurochka*. 

Liv has worked with Barbara Hannigan on Schoenberg’s String Quartet No. 2 for Juilliard’s ChamberFest, and tackled Babbitt’s *Philomel* from memory for the Focus! Festival. She was featured in the New York Festival Of Song’s "At Home" concert after a week of residency at the Caramoor Center for the Arts. Additionally, Liv had the privilege to sing a traditional Chinese song for Mme Peng Liyuan, the First Lady of China, at The Juilliard School's unveiling of their plans for a campus in China. With Juilliard415, she sang the Angelo in Handel’s *La resurrezione* under William Christie. Liv debuted at Carnegie Hall in Poulenc’s *Gloria* and Vaughan-Williams' *Hodie*; she returned to Carnegie last season to sing Handel’s *Messiah*. With the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra she has worked with George Benjamin on his A Mind of Winter. 

She has spent her summers with Santa Fe Opera, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Wolf Trap Opera, The Aspen Music Festival and School, and Houston Grand Opera's Young Artists' Vocal Academy.

Liv is the second place winner of the 2016 Western Region of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, as well as the Palm Springs Vocal Competition, where she also won first place in the Peggy Cravens Rossini Competition. She has been a grant winner with the Licia Albanese Puccini Competition and was awarded the Novick Career Advancement Grant and the Richard F. Gold Award from The Juilliard School.

Liv is a native of Edina, Minnesota where her spirit animal--Mimì the Yorkie-Poodle--resides, along with her parents and younger brother. In her free time she enjoys reading, running, and dreaming her parents would bring Mimì to visit LA.
