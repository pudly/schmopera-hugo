Soprano Amina Edris has been hailed as a “revelation” (_Forum Opera_) and praised for her “lustrous” tone (_Opera News_). Born in Egypt and raised in New Zealand, she has blended her cultural background to create her own unique artistic identity, making her one of opera's most intriguing young stars. 

Amina's 21-22 season includes four exciting role debuts and several house debuts. She began her season in France with her role debut as Alice (_Robert le diable_) at Opéra national de Bordeaux, followed by her house and role debut at the Opéra du Rhin as Micaëla (_Carmen_). Another role and house debut comes next as she performs Violetta (_La Traviata_) at Opéra de Limoges followed by her house debut in the same role at the Canadian Opera Company. She ends her season with a return to the Opéra de Paris as La Folie (_Platée_). Amina recently “brought the Opera Bastille to their knees thanks to her unparalleled portrayal of the title-role” in Vincent Huguet’s new production of Massenet’s _Manon_ (Forum Opera). 

In future seasons, Amina will enjoy more house debuts at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and the Gran Teatre del Liceu Barcelona, as well as return appearances at Opéra de Limoges and other opera houses in the US and Europe. In previous seasons, Amina debuted the role of Manon to great critical acclaim at the Opéra national de Bordeaux, made her debut at the Grand-Théâtre de Genève as Fatime (_Les Indes galantes_) in a new production by Lydia Steier, performed the title-role in Gounod’s _Roméo et Juliette_ at the San Francisco Opera, and Glycère in Gounod’s _Sapho_ with Washington Concert Opera. Equally dazzling on the concert stage, Amina’s appearances include Fauré’s _Requiem_, Mahler’s Symphony no. 4, gala concerts at the Opéra National de Bordeaux and with Real Filharmonia de Galicia, and the Schwabacher Recital series with San Francisco Opera. 

Amina holds a Bachelor of Music from the University of Canterbury New Zealand, a Masters from the Wales International Academy of Voice and a post-graduate diploma from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. After completing her studies, Amina participated in the Merola Opera Program, subsequently becoming an Adler Fellow at the San Francisco Opera. Her many accolades include First Prize and the Audience Prize at the inaugural Concours Bordeaux Médoc Lyrique 2018, the Deborah Riedel award at the Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge Bel canto Competition, the prestigious Sydney Eisteddfod McDonald’s Operatic Aria Competition, and the Dame Heather Begg Award.
