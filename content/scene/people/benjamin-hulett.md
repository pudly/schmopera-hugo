Since leaving Oxford University, where he was a choral scholar at New College with a degree in music, Benjamin Hulett has worked with many of Britain's leading choirs and orchestras. He is much in demand as an interpreter of music across a wide range of genres and has been hailed by the national press as one of the most promising young tenors of today. 

His recent concerts have included *Das Paradies und die Peri* with Sir Roger Norrington at the Edinburgh Festival, Haydn's *Creation* with both Pinnock and Haim, Missa Solemnis with Herreweghe, the title role of J.C. Bach's *Lucio Silla* for the Salzburg Mozartwoche and Ivor Bolton, and Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings with Christopher Hogwood; he has also appeared with Sir Andrew Davis, Harry Bicket, Fabio Biondi and regularly on tour with Philippe Herreweghe.  As a soloist with the Hamburgische Staatsoper his roles have included Flute (*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*), Jaquino (*Fidelio*), the Four Servants (*Les Contes d’Hoffmann*), Tamino (*Die Zauberflöte*), Ferrando (*Cosi fan tutte*) and Narraboth (*Salome*).  He made his debuts with the Bavarian State Opera as Oronte, Opera North as Peter Quint (*The Turn of the Screw*), for the Salzburg Festival in Elektra, at the Theater an der Wien in the world premiere of Johannes Kalitzke's *Die Besessenen*, with the Deutsche Staatsoper, Berlin in Henze's *Phaedra*, the Baden-Baden Festival in Salome, and the Rome Opera as Madwoman in *Curlew River*, returning as Gonzalve in *L'heure Espagnole*. He sang Tamino in a concert performance of *Die Zauberflöte* with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle, and made his debut with the Royal Opera House Covent Garden as Edmondo in *Manon Lescaut*. 

His engagements this season include Bernstein’s *A Quiet Place* with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and Nagano, Tamino for the Welsh National Opera, his debut with the Glyndebourne Festival in Handel’s *Saul*, and his first full recital at the Wigmore Hall.
