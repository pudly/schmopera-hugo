French tenor Benjamin Bernheim has quickly emerged as an artist to watch, and has been heralded as “a revelation” with a distinctive voice that is “flawless and pure, ranging from delicate pianissimo to heroic fortissimo as required” (Opera News). Following his success as a member of the ensemble and as a resident artist at the Opernhaus Zürich, Mr. Bernheim is now featured in impressive debuts at renowned venues throughout Europe.

Engagements in the 2017/18 season include Benjamin’s Royal Opera House debut as Rodolfo in *La Boheme*, Alfredo in *La Traviata* at the Deutsche Oper and Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin, Rodolfo at the Paris Opera, his house debut in *Faust* (title role) at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and his house debut as Nemorino *L’Elisir d’Amore* at the Vienna State Opera. He will finish his triumphant season with a return to the Opernhaus Zürich as Alfredo in *La Traviata*.

Previous highlights include Tebaldo in *I Capuleti e i Montecchi*, Cassio in *Otello* and Rodolfo in *La bohème* for Opernhaus Zurich, Lensky in *Eugene Onegin* at Deutsche Oper Berlin, Rodolfo at the Semperoper Dresden, Laerte in *Hamlet* at the Opera de Lausanne, the title role in *Faust* at the Latvian National Opera and Alfredo in *La Traviata* with Deutsche Oper Berlin.
