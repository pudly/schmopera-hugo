Dutch-Canadian Soprano, Monica Huisman has been hailed as possessing a soprano voice that ’embodies both flawless technique and dramatic impact’ (Opera Canada). Ms. Huisman has delighted audiences from Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw to Guatemala City with the reputation of her ‘silken’ voice ‘consistently crafting each note into a work of art’ (Winnipeg Free Press).

She has soared on the stages of Vancouver Opera, Calgary Opera, Edmonton Opera, Pacific Opera Victoria, The Netherlands Opera, Manitoba Opera, Opera Ontario and Saskatoon Opera in productions of _Carmen_, _Marriage of Figaro_, _Cosi Fan Tutte_, _Don Giovanni_, _Cunning Little Vixen_, _La bohème_, _Magic Flute_, _Hansel und Gretel_ and _Lakmé_. Many of these performances have been broadcasted by CBC Radio on _Saturday Afternoon at the Opera_.

Equally at home in concert repertoire Ms. Huisman has thrilled audiences with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Toronto Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Guatemala Symphony Orchestra, Hamilton Philharmonic, Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, Regina Symphony Orchestra, Saskatoon Symphony, Concertgebouw Orkest, Radio-Symphony Orkest and Orchestra London in such works as Strauss’ _Four Last Songs_, Brahms’ _Requiem_, Haydn’s _Creation_ and Vaughan Williams’ _Sea Symphony_. Recent engagements included a return to Amsterdam in Smetana’s _The Bartered Bride_, Villa Lobos’ _Bachianas Brasileiras_ with the Rio International Cello Festival in Rio di Janeiro, and Mahler’s Symphony No. 4 with the Winnipeg Symphony, broadcast by the CBC. She was heard last season in Mendelssohn’s _Lobgesang_ and Four Songs for Cello and Voice with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_ with the Winnipeg Symphony and Handel’s _Messiah_.

In 2015-2016, she returned to the Vancouver Symphony for Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, a work also on her schedule for the Regina Symphony and, at home in Winnipeg, she sang Messiah. Upcoming engagements include Beethoven’s 9TH SYMPHONY with Regina Symphony Orchestra, FALSTAFF with Manitoba Opera and Mendelssohn’s ELIJAH with the WSO.
