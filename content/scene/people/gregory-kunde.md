Acclaimed throughout his career for his performances in French and Italian bel canto roles, Kunde has more recently earned a formidable reputation in Verdi and other dramatic repertoire. Since his critically acclaimed debut as Verdi’s Otello at La Fenice in 2012, he has performed this signature role in Valencia, Genoa, Salerno, Florence, Turin, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Seoul, and São Paulo. Other Verdi debuts in recent seasons include Arrigo *I vespri siciliani* and Riccardo *Un ballo in maschera* (Turin), Radames *Aida* (São Paulo), and Don Alvaro *La forza del destino* (Valencia). In the 2012/13 season, Kunde earned the unique distinction of being the only tenor in recorded history to perform both Rossini’s *Otello* and Verdi’s *Otello* in the same season – something he repeated last season and will do again this season.

Highlights of the current season include his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden as Manrico *Il trovatore*; his role debut in the title role of Donizetti’s *Roberto Devereux* in Madrid and Bilbao; Verdi’s *Otello* in Seville and Cincinnati; Rossini’s *Otello* at the Gran Teatre del Liceu; the title roles of both Idomeneo and *Samson et Dalila* in Valencia; and Des Grieux *Manon Lescaut* in Bilbao.

Engagements last season included Verdi’s *Otello* in São Paulo, Peralada and Seville; Rossini’s *Otello* (La Scala); Radames *Aida* (Arena de Verona); Pollione *Norma* (Gran Teatre del Liceu and La Fenice); and role debuts as Rodolfo *Luisa Miller* (Liège), Turriddu *Cavalleria Rusticana* and Canio *Pagliacci* (Bilbao), and Manrico *Il trovatore* (La Fenice).

Other recent roles include Enée *Les Troyens* (La Scala), Peter Grimes in *Santa Cecilia* with Pappano, Vasco da Gama *L'Africaine* (La Fenice), Gualtiero *Il Pirata* (Gran Teatre del Liceu), Raoul *Les Huguenots* (Opéra national du Rhin), Rodrigo *La donna del lago* (Theater an der Wien), and Faust *La damnation de Faust* (with Maestro Dutoit in Amsterdam).

Kunde’s rich discography includes Berlioz *Les Troyens* at the Théâtre du Châtelet (Opus Arte DVD, Gramophone magazine’s ‘DVD of the Year’), Berlioz *Benvenuto Cellini* (Virgin Classics CD, Gramophone's ‘Opera Recording of the Year’), *Benvenuto Cellini* with Sir Colin Davis (LSO Live CD), and Verdi’s *Otello* from the Palazzo Ducale in Venice (Unitel DVD).
