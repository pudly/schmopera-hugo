Hailed by The New York Times as “a bass with an attitude and the goods to back it up,” Matt Boehler has been critically acclaimed both for his dramatic skill and his vocal ability. With Wolf Trap Opera Company, Mr. Boehler garnered much praise in the title role in *Sweeney Todd*.
*The Washington Post* raved, “There are times, in fact, when this young man with a huge crossover career ahead of him is standing in a crowd of actors, and you’d swear he was the only person onstage.”
 
Last season, Mr. Boehler debuted with Dallas Opera as the Donkey in *Becoming Santa*, joined Musica Sacra for Handel’s *Messiah*, the Sacramento Chorale for Haydn’s *Harmoniemesse*, Bard Summerscape as Il Cieco in Mascagni’s *Iris*, and made his role debut as Baron Ochs in *Der Rosenkavalier* with Victory Hall Opera. The 2016-2017 season and beyond includes Rautavaara’s *Vigilia* at St. John of the Divine in New York, his much anticipated return to Canadian Opera Company as Sarastro in *Die Zauberflöte*, and Mr. Mister in Marc Blitzstein’s *The Cradle Will Rock* at Opera Saratoga. Future seasons include his debut with Opera Philadelphia as well as performances with Minnesota Opera, the Prototype Festival, Madison Opera, and the National Cathedral in Washington, DC.
