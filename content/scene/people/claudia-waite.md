American soprano Claudia Waite is an active soloist at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center in New York City. She has been a guest artist with Opera Orchestra of New York, Dallas Opera, San Francisco Opera, l'Opéra de Lyon, Opera Centruum Nederland, New Israeli Opera and many other major operas and orchestras around the world. Ms. Waite has been hailed by the press as "_superlatively gifted_", "_perfection in her own right_", and a "_dominant musical force onstage_". Worldwide audiences saw the soprano as a featured soloist in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, under the baton of Maestro Seiji Ozawa, at the Opening Ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Since her debut bow that same year at the Metropolitan Opera, the soprano has participated in such diverse productions as _Die Zauberflöte, Dialogues des Carmelites, War and Peace, Der Rosenkavalier, Nabucco, Don Giovanni_ and _The Nose_. A former Adler Fellow, Ms. Waite appeared in numerous productions at San Francisco Opera, including _Macbeth, Elektra, Die Walküre, Cosí fan tutte, La Boheme, Rusalka_, and the North American premiere of Sir Michael Tippett's _King Priam_. The soprano's repertoire includes many of opera's most exciting leading ladies: Sieglinde (_Die Walküre_), Countess Almaviva (_Le Nozze di Figaro_), and Leonora (_Fidelio_ and _Il Trovatore_); the comedic roles of Rosalinda (_Die Fledermaus_), Fata Morgana (_L'Amour des Trois Oranges_), and La Duchesse (_La Grande Duchesse de Gerolstein_); as well as the title characters of _Turandot, Lucrezia Borgia,_ and _Anna Bolena_.

As a concert artist, Ms. Waite has appeared as the soprano soloist in the Verdi Requiem, Beethoven's _Missa Solemnis_, and Barber's _Knoxville: Summer of 1915_. As a soloist in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the soprano has appeared with the Jacksonville Symphony, Tulsa Philharmonic, New Japan Philharmonic, and with the San Francisco Opera, as part of the United Nations 50th Anniversary Celebration. The Houston Philharmonic, New Haven Symphony, Abilene Philharmonic, San Angelo Symphony, Abbey Road Concert Series (London), Sonora Bach Festival, and Kerrville Performing Arts Series have all featured the soprano in concerts programmed with the great standards of operatic repertoire. Art song recitals are a staple of the soprano's annual performance calendar.

Most recently the soprano was most recently seen at l'Opéra de Lyon and at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence in William Kentridge's production of Shostakovich's _The Nose._ In Spring 2012 the soprano returned to The Metropolitan Opera for turns in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ and _Macbeth._ Summer of 2012 will find the soprano in France, singing a recital at the Festival Lyrique de Montperreux. During the fall 2012 season at the Metopolitan, Ms. Waite will appear in the English language, "family friendly", holiday version of _Il barbiere di Siviglia_. The 2013-2014 season will see the soprano reprise her roles in Shostakovich's "The Nose".

Ms. Waite can be heard on the Albany Press release "An American Voice: The Music of Robert Nelson". Soon to be released on DVD is the soprano's performance in the new Metropolitan Opera production of _Il Barbiere di Siviglia,_ recently rebroadcast on PBS' _Great Performances_.
