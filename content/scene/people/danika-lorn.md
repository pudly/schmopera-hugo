As a performer, Danika is known for her versatility and dramatic sensitivity. Recent graduate of the Canadian Opera Company's ensemble program, her roles include Musetta (_La Bohéme_), Adina (_L'elisir d'amore_), Rosina (_Il Barbiere di Siviglia_), Dalinda (_Ariodante_), Lauretta (_Gianni Schicchi_), Susanna (_Le Nozze di Figaro_), Lady with a Hand Mirror (_Postcard from Morocco_), Coloratura (_Kopernikus_), Monica (_The Medium_), Woglinde (_Götterdämmerung_) and Zdenka (_Arabella_). 

​Danika has had the opportunity to work with some of the finest orchestras in Canada, including the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra, the Regina Symphony Orchestra, the Elora Festival Orchestra, Pax Christi Chorale and the University of Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Concert repertoire includes Faure’s _Requiem_, Handel's _Messiah_, Haydn's _Die Schöpfung_, Mozart’s _Requiem_ and Coronation Mass, Orff's _Carmina Burana_ and R. Strauss’ Op. 27, _Vier Lieder_. Danika’s finesse in competition has earned her first prize in the FCMF National Music Festival in 2011, first prize in the University of Toronto Concerto Competition in 2014/15, first prize in the 2016/17 Christina and Louis Quilico Awards, and a test recording with Deutsche Grammophon in the Stella Maris vocal competition in 2018.

​Danika pursued a bachelor's of fine arts in Drama at the University of Saskatchewan. She has since completed her bachelor’s degree in Vocal Performance at the University of Toronto under the instruction of J. Patrick Raftery. In 2016, Ms Lorèn completed master's degree in Opera from the same institution, studying with Wendy Nielsen.
