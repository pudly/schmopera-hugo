Hailed as "Heartbreakingly intense", tenor Dominick Corbacio is a quickly emerging young artist with a rapidly growing repertoire spanning opera, oratorio, and art song.

A native of Syracuse, NY, he recently performed as the tenor soloist in Handel's _Messiah_ with the Hamilton Masterworks Chorale and Symphoria in Upstate New York. In October 2015 he was featured as a guest artist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Mingwei’s performance art piece Sonic Blossom. He was subsequently praised by The New York Times for having given “one excellent performance after another…”. 

Dominick made his debut as an apprentice artist with Opera Saratoga in 2015, singing the role of the Sailor in Karole Armitage’s production of _Dido and Aeneas_, as well as covering the role of Castleman in the world premiere of Jeremy Howard Beck’s _The Long Walk_. While in residence at Opera Saratoga, Dominick won first prize in the inaugural Saratoga Sings! competition. In 2015 he also performed the roles of Steven Todd and Arnold Murray in a concert reading of _The Life and Death(s) of Alan Turing_ by Justine F. Chen with American Lyric Theater at Merkin Concert Hall in New York.

Other recent credits include Prince Sou Chong (_Das Land des Lächelns_), Ballad Singer (_Of Mice and Men_), Tony (_West Side Story_), Ernesto (_Don Pasquale_), Nemorino (_L’elisir d’amore_), Don Ottavio (_Don Giovanni_), Vogelsang (_Der Schauspieldirektor_), and Robert (_Hin und Zurück_) with such companies of Venture Opera, Phoenicia International Festival of the Voice, Manhattan School of Music and Eastman Opera Theatre. 

Aside from his operatic and stage experience, Dominick is also an experienced cantor, soloist, section leader and music director. He has over 10 years of experience working with choirs and churches across New York state.
