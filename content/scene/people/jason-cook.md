A native of Vancouver, “lovely lyric baritone” (_Georgia Straight_) Jason Cook holds an undergraduate degree from the UBC School of Music with a major in Voice Performance, is a member of the Vancouver Opera Ensemble and a piano graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Music. With his roots in traditional choral performance and musical theatre, the marriage of these two styles led Jason to the operatic stage. Notable roles include Figaro (_Il barbiere di Siviglia_), Don Giovanni, Papageno (_Die Zauberflöte_), Gianni Schicchi, Danilo (_Die lustige Witwe_), Reverend Olin Blitch (_Susannah_), Marcello (_La Bohème_) and Count Almaviva (_Le nozze di Figaro_). _Opera Canada_ claims his recent portrayal of Escamillo in Burnaby Lyric Opera’s production of _Carmen_ was “brilliantly sung and pricelessly acted. Following his “delightful” and “on point” (_Vancouver Presents_) performance as Prince Charming and the Wolf in Sondheim’s _Into the Woods_, he received a Community Theatre Coalition award for ‘Lead Actor in a Musical’. This young artist is also well versed in oratorio, chamber music and art song - now broadening his repertoire by engaging in the world of original Canadian compositions. Jason has had the privilege of performing across Canada, Europe, China and Australia representing Canadian opera singers in a variety of styles and languages. On top of his performance schedule, Mr. Cook is also a busy teacher operating his own music studio.
