American Cecelia Hall is one of today’s most established young mezzo-sopranos. Hailed by the Financial Times for her 'easy flexibility, arresting poise and enveloping warmth', she has appeared since 2014 in leading roles at many of the world’s finest stages, including Munich’s Bayerische Staatsoper, The Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Canadian Opera Company, Opera Philadelphia, and Oper Frankfurt, where she is a member of the ensemble.

This season, Cecelia Hall returns to the Oper Frankfurt for some exciting repertoire: Hänsel in _Hänsel und Gretel_, Marguerite in _La Damnation de Faust_, Cherubino in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and the Zweite Dame in _Die Zauberflöte_. In concert, Ms. Hall will sing _Les Nuits d’Eté_ with the Bay Atlantic Symphony and _Trouble in Tahiti_ with the Lexington Philharmonic.

Ms. Hall began the 2017-18 season with a return to Opera Philadelphia, where she starred in _War Stories_ (a double bill of Monteverdi's _Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda_ and Beecher's _I Have No Stories To Tell You_) as part of the Festival 017, for which she was featured on the cover of Opera News in August 2017. She then returned to Oper Frankfurt to debut the title role of Purcell's _Dido and Aeneas_ and the leading lady in the world's first staging of Zelenka's _Il Serpente di Bronzo_. Ms. Hall’s other roles in Frankfurt included Dorabella in _Così fan tutte_, Vlasta in _Die Passagierin_, and Wellgunde in _Das Rheingold_.

Ms. Hall joined the ensemble at Oper Frankfurt in 2016-17 and was featured as Fulvia in Gluck’s _Ezio_ and Zerlina in _Don Giovanni_. She also made her Russian debut singing Komponist in _Ariadne auf Naxos_ with Maestro Vladimir Jurowski and the Moscow Philharmonic Society, followed by a return to the USA to sing Cherubino in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ with Opera Philadelphia and Sesto in _La Clemenza di Tito_ with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis.

Ms. Hall’s 2015-16 season included performances of Dorabella in _Così Fan Tutte_ with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, followed by recitals with the Metropolitan Opera Rising Stars Concert Series, Zerlina in _Don Giovanni_ with NYC’s Venture Opera, and her role debut as Ruby Thewes in the east coast premiere of Jennifer Higdon’s _Cold Mountain_ with Opera Philadelphia. Ms. Hall also returned to North Carolina Opera to sing Rosina in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ and to Opera Theatre of Saint Louis to sing the Composer in _Ariadne on Naxos_. Her season concluded with performances of Geisha/Dhia in Mascagni’s _Iris_ with Bard Summerscape and with her Mostly Mozart debut as the mezzo soloist in Mozart’s Mass in C minor and Requiem with Maestro Louis Langrée.

The 2014-15 season included Ms. Hall’s return to the Metropolitan Opera as Javotte in Manon, a debut at the Canadian Opera Company as Rosina in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ and at the Bayerische Staatsoper as Cherubino in _Le Nozze di Figaro_, and a return to the Seattle Opera as Zerlina in _Don Giovanni_. Other highlights included a return to Carnegie Hall for the 2015 Marilyn Horne Song Celebration, a Metropolitan Opera-sponsored Mozart recital at the NJPAC and her debut at the Santa Fe Opera as Don Ramiro in _La Finta Giardiniera_.

In 2013-14, Ms. Hall debuted as Dorabella in _Così Fan Tutte_ with North Carolina Opera and Zerlina in _Don Giovanni_ with Opera Philadelphia, sang a Spotlight Recital with The Song Continues at Carnegie Hall, and returned to Lyric Opera of Chicago to sing Annio in _La Clemenza di Tito_. In concert, Ms. Hall appeared as the Page in _Salome_ with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Over the summer, she made her Aix-en-Provence Festival debut as Zaida in Rossini’s _Il Turco in Italia_. She then sang a concert of Baroque Masterworks with La Jolla Music Society’s SummerFest, and finished the summer with the Bard Music Festival as Florinda in Schubert’s _Fierrabras_.

An alumna of the Metropolitan Opera’s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s Ryan Opera Center, Ms. Hall appeared at the Lyric Opera as Third Maid in _Elektra_, Alisa in _Lucia di Lammermoor_, and Second Lady in _Die Zauberflöte_, among other roles. She recently made debuts with the Seattle Opera as Wellgunde and Rossweisse in their 2013 _Ring des Nibelungen_ and with the Fort Worth Opera as the Komponist in _Ariadne auf Naxos_ (a role she previously sang with the Palau de les Arts in Valencia, Spain and at the Tanglewood Music Festival).

Ms. Hall received much critical acclaim for her performance in the title-role of Handel’s Teseo at Chicago Opera Theater, and she has also debuted at the Metropolitan Opera as the Second Priestess in _Iphigénie en Tauride_. At the Castleton Festival, she has appeared as Rosina in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_ and L’Enfant in Ravel’s _L’Enfant et les Sortilèges_. At Juilliard Opera she was featured as Concepción in _L’Heure Espagnole_, Nerone in _L’Incoronazione di Poppea_, Cherubino in _Le Nozze di Figaro_, and in the title role of _Ariodante_.

A noted recitalist, Cecelia Hall has appeared several times at Carnegie Hall, both with the Horne Foundation and with Carnegie’s Ensemble ACJW. As a Samling Artist, she sang in recital at Wigmore Hall.
