Born in Victoria, Canada, bass Jeremy Bowes recently finished two seasons with the Sächsische Staatsoper Dresden. He has been described as, “a promising bass whose, I rage, I melt, I burn, was a highlight of the evening… [he is] easy on all the senses and moves with natural chemistry onstage…” (*Montreal Gazette*). His roles with the Semperoper included Colline in Puccini’s *La bohème*, Zuniga in Bizet’s *Carmen*, The King in Cui’s *Der gestiefelte Kater* and the Warden in Heggie’s *Dead Man Walking*. 

In the spring of 2010 he graduated from Yale with a Masters in Music where he received his principal vocal training from Richard Cross. While at Yale he performed the roles of Figaro in Mozart’s *Le nozze di Figaro*, Sarastro, Second Armed Guard and The Speaker in Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte*, The Bonze in Stravinsky’s *Le rossignol* as well as the Bass solo in Verdi’s *Requiem* with the Yale Symphony Orchestra. He also appeared as Luka in William Walton’s *The Bear* in the Ischia summer music festival in Napoli, Italy. He recently made his hometown operatic debut in Victoria, British Columbia as Pistola in Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Verdi’s *Falstaff*. Last season was engaged for Nabucco and Kevin Puts’ *Silent Night* with l’Opéra de Montréal, *Elijah* with the Kingston Symphony, Pärt’s *Passio* with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and returned to Pacific Opera Victoria as the Bonze in *Madama Butterfly*.

In the 2015-2016 season he concentrates his operatic energies on Canada’s west coast where he will be heard as the Bonze in *Madama Butterfly* for Vancouver Opera, and Lodovico in *Otello* and Flowers in a tour of *Mary’s Wedding* for Pacific Opera Victoria. His concert engagements take him to the Winnipeg Symphony for *Messiah* and for the Windsor Symphony, he sings Colline in a concert performance of *La Boheme*.
