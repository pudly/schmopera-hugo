Sean Clark is quickly becoming established as one of Canada’s most promising young tenors. A graduate of the Opera Diploma program at the University of Toronto, Sean holds an Undergraduate degree from Ithaca College and a Masters degree from Arizona State University.

Sean’s operatic repertoire spans a broad range of roles, including Don Ottavio (*Don Giovanni*), Male Chorus (*The Rape of Lucretia*), Remendado (*Carmen*) King Kaspar (*Amahl and the Night Visitors*), Chevalier de la Force (*Dialogues of the Carmelites*), Lurcanio (*Ariodante*) and Alfred (*Die Fledermaus*).

In 2008 Sean sang the Canadian premiere of Doreen Rao's new arrangement of Bernstein's Mass and the next year he starred in Lance Horne's one-man opera *The Tell-Tale Heart* at the Luminato Festival, Toronto's summer celebration of arts and creativity. The following summer he had the honour of taking part in Rufus Wainwright's opera *Prima Donna*, again with Luminato Festival.

Continuing his focus on contemporary repertoire, Sean recently sang in the Ensemble for *Airline Icarus*, the critically acclaimed new opera by Brian Current for Soundstreams Canada, directed by Tim Albery and looks forward to presenting Canadian works in his recital “Canucks a la Carte: 21st Century Virtuoso” for the Canadian Music Centre. 

Sean joins the Opera Lyra Ottawa Studio in September 2014, singing the role of Tamino in their English-language production of *The Magic Flute* for young audiences followed by guest appearances with Pax Christi Chorale as tenor soloist in Bach’s *Nun komm der Heiden Heiland* and Stephanie Martin’s secular cantata *Winter Nights*. 

In December 2014, Sean debuted as Ottavio in Against the Grain's critically acclaimed production of *#UncleJohn*, Joel Ivany's updated version of Mozart's *Don Giovanni*.
