Canadian-Russian baritone Andrey Andreychik is an avid performer that brings passion to operatic repertoire spanning from standard pieces to the creation of contemporary roles. Praised as having a "stoic, manly sound" in his "unfailingly seductive" portrayal of Don Giovanni [*Schmopera*; *Opera Canada*] and "bringing a powerful baritone & exceptional acting abilities" to the title character in Somers' *Louis Riel* [*Opera Canada*], Andrey’s most recent performances include Vladimir Galitsky in the Canadian Premiere of *Prince Igor* with Voicebox; Toronto Opera in Concert and Escamillo in Loose TEA Music Theatre’s *Carmen* (for which he was hailed as "having the perfect balance of swagger, darkness, and unintentional smarm" [*Schmopera*]).

Originally from in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, Andrey moved to Canada in 2008, receiving a diploma in operatic performance from the University of British Columbia soon after. Following graduation, Andrey made his professional debut as Figaro in *Il Barbiere Di Siviglia* with Theater Hof in Germany, and has since performed in China, Italy, Spain, Canada, Russia, and the United States. Andrey is a laureate of several Russian National vocal competitions, a finalist in the XVII Concorso Internazionale per Cantanti Lirici “Spazio Musica” in Italy, and a winner of Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques in Montreal. Additional performance highlights include Count Almaviva (Centre for Opera Studies in Italy), the Vampire in *Der Vampyr* (SOLT), *Gianni Schicchi* (Burnaby Lyric Opera), and Albert Speer in the 2015 premiere of Andrew Ager’s *Führerbunker* (COSI Connection). Upcoming engagements include a recital of "Russian Romances" for the Vancouver Women's Musical Society in January 2017, and the role of Prince Khovansky in the Canadian Premiere of Mussorgsky’s *Khovanshchina* with Voicebox; Toronto Opera in Concert in March 2017. Andrey also holds a degree in International Economics, and when not singing can be found doting upon his cat, Hugo Wolf.
