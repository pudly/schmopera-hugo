**Keith Klassen** has emerged to become one of Canada’s busiest tenors, averaging 12 productions a season since graduating with honours from the Opera Division at the University of Toronto in 2002. He has been engaged across Canada as well as in Scotland, Germany, the United States, Ireland and the Czech Republic. The _Star Phoenix_ described him as having “a big ringing voice and great stage presence”; Classical 96.3 added, “Klassen’s voice is pure honey with its ease of high notes and the lyrical grace of his phrasing”; _Opera Canada_ raved that his Rodolfo was “dramatically convincing, sung with passionate sincerity ensuring the audience’s love”; **John Terauds** of the _Toronto Star_ called him “one of the country’s most versatile artists”; and _NOW_ magazine’s **Jon Kaplan** went so far as to rate Keith as one of Toronto’s top ten theatre artists of 2006.
