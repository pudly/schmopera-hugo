<p>
	Canadian soprano, Betty Waynne Allison is becoming known to audiences as one who "combines it all -- voice, acting ability, presence and beauty -- in one highly impressive package" (Toronto Sun).
</p>
<p>
	<span class="style_1">Based out of her home in British Columbia, she is the product of the Canadian Opera Company's Ensemble. Major credits to her name include Anna in Against the Grain Theatre's <em>#UncleJohn</em>; the world premier of MARY'S WEDDING with Pacific Opera Victoria; the title role in Floyd's SUSANNAH with Florentine Opera; Alice in Verdi's FALSTAFF with L'Opèra Thèâtre de Metz Mètropole; and Rosalinde in DIE FLEDERMAUS with Edmonton Opera. Early roles in the COC Ensemble included Fiordiligi (COSI FAN TUTTE), Donna Anna (DON GIOVANNI), and Turnspit (RUSALKA).</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="style_1">Betty has performed a versatile repertoire, demonstrating her natural ability and talent from the Countess (LE NOZZE DI FIGARO) and Tatiana (EUGENE ONEGIN) to Vixen (CUNNING LITTLE VIXEN) and Elizabeth I (GLORIANA). Betty is equally comfortable on the concert stage, with her rich and florid interpretation of pieces such as Symphony VIII by Mahler, Brahms' Requiem and Gubaidulia's GALGENLIEDER A 3. </span>
