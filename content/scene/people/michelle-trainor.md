Opera News hailed that "Michelle Trainor gave one of the most satisfying performances of the evening...her voice is richer and more expressive than ever" for her portrayal of Brangain in Boston Lyric Opera’s _The Love Potion_. The Musical Intelligencer has called her performance of _Hagar’s Lament_ "spell-binding and intense" and The Wall Street Journal acclaimed that she "displayed a powerful, penetrating soprano as Brangain." Michelle performed with the Tuscia Opera Festival in Viterbo, Italy where she was praised by Filippo Tadonlini for her "intense and full-bodied vocalism". 

This season will be bringing many debut roles for Ms. Trainor. The season begins with the role of Benoni in Gounod’s lesser known work, _La Reine de Saba_ with Odyssey Opera followed by the role of Berta in Rossini’s _The Barber of Seville_ with Boston Lyric Opera. She makes her debut with Michigan Opera Theatre as Berta in their production of _The Barber of Seville_ directed by Christopher Mattaliano and will be making her debut with Boston Modern Orchestra Project in their performance of _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ singing the roles Oneeta/Princess/Batcheat. In the spring she will be singing the role of Ofglen in Ruder’s _The Handmaid’s Tale_ directed by Anne Bogart with Boston Lyric Opera and is excited to revisit the character Mrs. Peachum, in Britten’s, _The Beggar’s Opera_ with Emmanuel Music. 

In the 2017/2018 season Michelle created the role of Helen McDougal in the World premiere of Julian Grant’s _The Nefarious, Immoral but Highly Profitable Enterprise of Mr. Burke & Mr. Hare_ with Boston Lyric Opera. She will also be debuting the role of Mrs. Peachum in Weill’s _The Threepenny Opera_ with Boston Lyric Opera as well as Jocaste in Stravinsky’s _Oedipus Rex_ with Emmanuel Music. She will be returning to the Nashua Symphony as the soprano soloist in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and will join the SNHU and Manchester Chorale as the soprano soloist in Mahler’s Symphony No. 2. 

The 2016/2017 season, along with her Boston Symphony Orchestra debut in _Der Rosenkavalier_ she joined the Brookline Symphony Orchestra for Isolde’s Liebestod from Wagner’s _Tristan und Isolde_. Michelle returns to the Boston Lyric Opera stage to sing the role of Marcellina in _Le Nozze di Figaro_, will make her Odyssey Opera debut as Ghita in Zemlinsky’s _Der Zwerg_ and will be the soprano soloist in Vaughan Williams’ _A Sea Symphony_ with New World Chorale. 

2015/2016 season brought Michelle back to New Hampshire at First Church where she sang Nicholas White's _Magnificat_. She reprised the role of Tosca with La Forza dell' Opera in Brooklyn, NY and performed in the Boston Lyric Opera production of _The Merry Widow_. In past seasons she took on the challenging role of Brangain in Martin's _The Love Potion_ to much critical acclaim and she revived her role as Suor Angelica where she was nominated by ArtsImpulse for Best Female Performer in an Opera. Ms. Trainor sang a staged version of Schubert's early song _Hagar's Lament_ and recorded this production on the BIS label.
