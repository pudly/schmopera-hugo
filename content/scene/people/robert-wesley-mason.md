Wes has been celebrated for his visceral story telling ability where he "deploys his mighty baritone to stunning effect, using interpretive phrasing and nuanced delivery” (Albany Times Union). This past November, Wes returned to Nashville Opera in his role debut as Charlie in Heggie and Scheer’s _Three Decembers_. This winter he returns to Fargo-Moorhead Opera for another run of _Three Decembers_ as well as Escamillo in Carmen, followed by his debut with Eugene Opera, reprising the role of Hannah Before in Kaminski, Campbell, and Reed’s _As One_. Additionally, this summer will see two more company and role debuts as he joins Urban Arias as a soloist in their production of Elvis Costello’s _The Juliet Letters_ and West Edge Opera for the West Coast Premiere of Mazzoli and Vavrek’s _Breaking the Waves_ as Jan Nyman.

An acclaimed interpreter of modern works as well as the traditional cavalier baritone repertoire, past highlights include the title role in _Hamlet_ with Fort Worth Opera, Stanley Kowalski in _A Streetcar Named Desire_ with Kentucky Opera, Father Flynn in _Doubt_ with Union Avenue Opera, Jonathan in _Siren Song_ with Hawaii Opera Theatre, Ping in _Turandot_ with Nashville Opera, the title role in _Guillaume Tell_ with the Southern Illinois Music Festival, Belcore in _L’elisir d’amore_ with Gulfshore Opera, Masetto in _Don Giovanni_ with Opera Philadelphia and Opera Naples, Achilla in _Giulio Cesare_ with Opera Roanoke, Escamillo in _La Tragédie de Carmen_ with Syracuse Opera, Marcello in _La bohème_ with Hawaii Opera Theatre, Fort Worth Opera, and Norwalk Symphony, Schaunard in _La bohème_ with the Crested Butte Music Festival, Zurga in _Les pêcheurs de perles_ with Opera Delaware and Baltimore Concert Opera, the baritone soloist in _Broadway Extravaganza_ with Opera Hong Kong, Sciarrone in _Tosca_ with Dallas Opera, and Morales in _Carmen_ with the Glimmerglass Festival.

Wes has also performed as Billy Bigelow in _Carousel_ with Union Avenue Opera and Utah Festival Opera, Curly in _Oklahoma!_ with Maryland Live Arts and Utah Festival Opera, and Mac and Frank Butler (understudy) in _Annie Get Your Gun_ with the Glimmerglass Festival. He participates in readings of new works as often as possible. 

Mr. Mason has been featured on the cast recordings of _Three Way_ as Dax/Larry with Naxos and _Before Night Falls_ as Reinaldo Arenas with Albany Records (credited as Wes Mason). He has also received awards from the Sullivan Foundation, The Loren L Zachary Society, and The Metropolitan Opera National Council. Wes graduated from the Academy of Vocal Arts and the University of Michigan where he was presented the Earl V. Moore Award for outstanding contribution to the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance.
