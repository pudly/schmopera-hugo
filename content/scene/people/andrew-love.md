Calgary native Andrew Love is in the enviable position of balancing his time between engagements on Broadway and on the opera stage. Heard as the Bishop and Javert (understudy) in _Les Misérables_ in Toronto, he was also engaged for the same roles in the 2014 Broadway revival of the show and the National Tour that ran from 2017 - 2020. In 2017-2018, Andrew also joined Pacific Opera Victoria for Schaunard in _La bohème_, the Regina Symphony for the Fauré _Requiem_, and appeared as Baron Duphol in _La traviata_ for Manitoba Opera. He continued his 2018 season in St. John’s where he made his company and role debut singing Hannah Before in _As One_ for Opera on the Avalon. He re-joined the company in the fall of 2018 for the role of Thomas Nangle in John Estacio's _Ours_. He returned to his hometown in early 2019 for the Canadian Premiere of Joby Talbot's _Everest_.

In the 2016-2017 season, he starred as Charlie in the Calgary Opera production of _Filumena_, Marcello in _La bohème_ for Against the Grain Theatre, and Schultz in _Louis Riel_ for the Canadian Opera Company, at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa and for Opéra de Québec.

Further credits include Baron Douphol in _La traviata_ (Calgary Opera/Opéra de Québec), Papageno in _The Magic Flute_ (Highlands Opera), Lord Cecil in _Maria Stuarda_ and Dancaïre in _Carmen_, both for Pacific Opera Victoria, Marco in _Gianni Schicchi_ with Calgary Opera, Silvio in _Pagliacci_ (Opera Hamilton), Figaro in _Le nozze di Figaro_ (Saskatoon Opera) and Sid in _Albert Herring_ (Opera on the Avalon).
