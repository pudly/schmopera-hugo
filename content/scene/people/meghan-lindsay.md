Canadian soprano Meghan Lindsay has been praised by OPERA NEWS for a voice that "shines with greater vocal strength and control than ever before and dazzles with her coloratura passages.” Following a performance of Alcina celebrated as "graced with a bright, limpid instrument, luscious timbre and superb technique," Meghan returned to Opera Atelier as Amour in Gluck’s _Orphée et Eurydice_, Giunia in the Canadian premiere of Mozart’s _Lucio Silla_, Belinda and _Dido and Aeneas_, and Minerva in _Il ritorno d'ulisse in patria._ A frequent interpreter of French Baroque repertoire, Meghan has performed the roles of Sidonie/Nymphe des Eaux (Lully's _Armide_), Vénus (Lully's _Persée_), and Nérine (Charpentier's _Medée)_ at The Royal Opera House of the Palace of Versailles. In 2018/19, Meghan's role debuts include Sandrina in _La Finta Giardiniera_ (Opera Nova Scotia), Arethuze/Hunter and Galatée in a double bill of _Actéon_ and _Pygmalion_ (Opera Atelier/Royal Opera Versailles/Harris Theatre Chicago), Paride in Gluck's _Paride ed Elena_ (Odyssey Opera), and Ilia in _Idomeneo_ (Opera Atelier)

Meghan made her recording debut with the Grammy-nominated early music company, Ars Lyrica, in a recording and ‘modern world’ premiere of Scarlatti’s _La Sposa dei Cantici_. Equally at home in Romantic repertoire, Meghan has performed the the title role of Luisa Miller with Opera Nova Scotia, Mimi in _La bohème_ with The Northern Lights Festival, and Agathe in _Der Freischütz_. She made her U.S. operatic debut with Opera Columbus as Donna Anna in _Don Giovanni_ and performed Sidonie/Nymphe des Eaux in Lully's _Armide_ with the Glimmerglass Festival.

Meghan was a young artist with Opera Studio Nederland where she made her European debut as Euridice in Pierre Audi’s production of Monteverdi’s _L’Orfeo_ and made her Concertgebouw debut singing Donna Anna. An accomplished concert artist, Meghan has been featured on CTV television and CBC radio broadcast. Meghan performed at Carnegie Hall as a member of the _The Song Continues_ workshop with the Weil Institute, and has presented recitals internationally including a concert tour of China, Barrie’s Colours of Music, the Creemore Music Festival, the Houston Early Music Festival, and Holland’s Uitmarkt. Meghan is the winner of the Brian Law Competition and was a semi-finalist in the Queen Elisabeth Competition. She is an alumni of the Glimmerglass Festival Young Artist Program; The Toronto Summer Music Festival; the International Vocal Arts Institute; the Daniel Ferro Vocal Program; Opera Studio Nederland; and of The Royal Conservatory of Music’s Glenn Gould School, where she completed her Bachelor of Music and participated in the Artist Diploma Program.
