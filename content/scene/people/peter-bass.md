Peter Bass is a baritone based out of Toronto. Originally from Edmonton, Alberta, Peter recently completed his Bachelor of Music in Voice Performance at the University of Toronto. Previous to his university training, Peter completed the Theatre Arts diploma at Grant MacEwan College and proceeded to work as an actor for the next eight years.
 
This theatre training has given Peter many tools to successfully perform roles in the operatic repertoire. In 2014, he performed Achilla in *Giulio Cesare*, Basilio in *The Barber of Cowtown*, Vater in *Hänsel und Gretel*, and Dulcamara in *L'Elisir d'Amore*. Other roles include the title role in Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi  (2013), Sid in *Albert Herring* and the Perückenmacher in *Ariadne Auf Naxos* (2012), Peter Quince in *A Midsummer’s Night Dream* (2012), and multiple roles in Dean Burry’s *The Brother’s Grimm*. In addition to opera, Peter has performed in many musical theatre productions. Notable productions include *She Loves Me*; *Johnny Guitar*; *Promises, Promises*; *Titanic*; *Anything Goes* and the world premier of the musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s *A Winter’s Tale*.
 
Peter was awarded the Douglas Bodle-St. Andrew’s Award: awarded to a student who, upon graduating from the Performance program in Voice, is deemed to have the strongest potential in the area of Oratorio and concert repertoire. Peter has performed both Faure’s *Requiem* and Mozart’s *Requiem*. He has also sung many oratorio selections such as Britten’s *War Requiem*, Dvorak’s *Requiem*, Saint-Saens’ *Oratorio de Noël*, Handel’s *Messiah*, and Mendelssohn’s *Paulus* and *Elijah* to name a few.
 
Peter’s passion for music and drama is infectious both on and off stage.
