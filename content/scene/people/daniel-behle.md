Daniel Behle is one of the most versatile German tenors and is equally successful in the concert, lied and opera genres. His extensive repertoire ranges from Baroque masterpieces to Classical and Romantic works to compositions of the 20th and 21st centuries.

The year 2017 marks an absolute highlight in his carreer, including concert debuts with Santa Cecilia Rome (*Lobgesang* with Pablo Heras-Casado), Gewandhausorchester Leipzig (*Jahreszeiten* with Trevor Pinnock), Wiener Symphoniker (*St. John Passion* with Philippe Jordan), Balthasar-Neumann-Ensemble (*St. John Passion* with Thomas Hengelbrock), and Berlin Philharmonic (*Missa solemnis* with Christian Thielemann), as well as his debut at the Bayreuth Festival as David in *Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg*.

In April 2014 he made his acclaimed debut as Matteo in Strauss’s *Arabella* at the Salzburg Easter Festival under Christian Thielemann. In 2015 he returned to Aix-en-Provence as Belmonte (*Die Entführung aus dem Serail*) and sang his first Wagner role: Erik in *Der fliegende Holländer* at the Frankfurt Opera. In September 2016 Daniel Behle makes his debut at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, performing Ferrando in *Così fan tutte*.

Daniel Behle appears in concert with renowned orchestras, including the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (RSB), DSO Berlin, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, SWR Radio Orchestra or the Stuttgart Bach Academy, working with such conductors as Stefan Asbury, Jiří Bělohlávek, Bertrand de Billy, Christoph Eschenbach, James Gaffigan, Marek Janowski, Ingo Metzmacher, Kent Nagano, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, George Petrou, Hans-Christoph Rademann, Jérémie Rhorer, Andreas Spering, Jeffrey Tate, and Christian Thielemann.

Daniel Behle fascinates his audiences as a lieder singer at such venues as the Schwetzingen Festival, the Schubertiade, the Prinzregenten Theater in Munich, the Cologne Philharmonie, Hamburg’s Laeiszhalle, the Beethoven House in Bonn, London’s Wigmore Hall and the Richard Strauss Festival in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

The artist has also made a name for himself as a composer. He premiered his Ringelnatz cycle at the Beethoven House Bonn in 2013. A milestone in his composing career is his arrangement of Schubert’s Winterreise for tenor and piano trio (Sony Classical). Following the UK premiere at the Wigmore Hall and the Germany premiere at the WDR Cologne, he will perform the Netherlands premiere at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam in January 2017. With *Mein Hamburg* (arrangements and new compositions for tenor and piano trio to be released in fall 2016) Daniel Behle pays musical tribute to his native city.

Daniel Behle was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2014 in the recording of Leonardo Vinci’s *Artaserse*. His lieder recordings and solo CDs, including *Die schöne Müllerin*, *Dichterliebe*, Strauss songs and Bach arias, have been praised by critics. His debut album for Decca (Gluck arias with Armonia Atenea) was released in 2014.
