Of particular note was Ms. Angelo’s starring role as Mabel Hubbard Bell in the July 2015 World Premiere of *The Bells of Baddeck* in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, the summer home of Alexander and Mabel Bell. Composed by Dean Burry to a libretto by Lorna MacDonald, the work celebrates the intriguing couple’s life and the creative inspiration he drew from the Maritime environment. Having received critical and popular acclaim in its inaugural season, *The Bells of Baddeck* will return to Cape Breton this summer, with Ms Angelo again in her starring role. Also in her the 2015/2016 season, Ms. Angelo will be featured in the North American premiere of Salieri’s *Falstaff* with Kevin Mallon conducting the Aradia Ensemble for VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert, and returns to the Off Centre Music Salon Series for The Cocktail Epoque. She will also release her debut album, Moon Loves Its Light.

A native of Nova Scotia, she debuted with the Toronto Symphony and has also appeared in Mozart’s *Requiem* for Symphony Nova Scotia and *Messiah* with the Edmonton Symphony and Vancouver Bach Choir. In the U.S., she sang with the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall under Keith Lockhart, and with the Tanglewood Festival Orchestra under Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos in Stravinski's *Pulcinella*. She was featured in the world premiere of Schafer’s *Children's Crusade* for Toronto’s Luminato Festival and participated in the workshop process for Vancouver Opera’s world premiere of *Lillian Alling*.

An avid recitalist, Ms Angelo has been heard in concert with the Aldeburgh Connection, Off Centre Music Series, the Three Churches Series in Mahone Bay, and the Orpheus Choir of Toronto. In the world of operetta she appeared as the leading lady in the Jeunesses Musicales du Canada production of *La veuve joyeuse* and with Toronto Operetta Theatre as Juliette in *The Count of Luxembourg* and Kristal in *The Bird Seller*. In concert, she sang Rossini’s *Petite messe solennelle* with the University of Ottawa Orchestra & Choirs and was a guest artist at the Governor General’s Arts Awards Gala. Ms. Angelo has also been a Vocal Fellow at the prestigious Tanglewood Music Center.

An alumna of Atelier Lyrique de L'Opéra de Montréal, Ms. Angelo appeared as the Governess in *The Turn of the Screw* and Belinda in *Dido and Aeneas* with the Atelier, as well as the High Priestess (*Aïda*), Naiad (*Ariadne auf Naxos*) and Rose (*Lakmé*) on the main stage.
