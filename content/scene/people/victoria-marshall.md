Mezzo-soprano Victoria Marshall is a sought-after interpreter of opera, oratorio, and art-song. She recently made her two professional debuts as guest soloist in Handel’s *Messiah* with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Case Scaglione and with the Regina Symphony Orchestra under Hart Godden. Ms. Marshall was also honoured to create the role of Vashti in the world premiere of the science-fiction opera, *The Machine Stops*, based on Forster’s short story.

Recent highlights include singing La Maestra Delle Novizie in Puccini's *Suor Angelica* (TrypTych Opera), Olga in Tchaikovsky’s *Eugene Onegin* (Muskoka Opera Festival), Bianca in Britten’s *The Rape of Lucretia* (MYOpera), Moppet in Britten’s *Paul Bunyan* (U of T Opera), Mrs. Nolan in Menotti’s *The Medium* (U of T Opera), and Madame de la Haltière in Massenet’s *Cendrillon* (Manitoba Underground Opera). While at the University of Manitoba, Victoria has sung Bianca/Princess Rosabella in Dean Burry’s *Angela and Her Sisters* and performed excerpts from *Dido and Aeneas* as The Sorceress.

Ms. Marshall is equally at home performing the works of the Baroque masters. She has appeared as a soloist performing such works as Bach’s B Minor Mass and *St. Matthew Passion*, Zelenka’s *Te Deum*, Monteverdi’s Vespers of 1610, and Vivaldi’s Gloria with such companies as Winnipeg’s Canzona, Camerata Nova, and Toronto's Cor Unum Ensemble.  Ms. Marshall studies with Wendy Nielsen in Toronto, and has formerly studied with Mel Braun at the U of M Desautels Faculty of Music.
