Canadian-American soprano Othalie Graham continues to receive critical acclaim throughout North America. Widely known for her interpretation of the title role in *Turandot*, the Boston Globe noted that her “timbre and power were thrilling – steely ring from top to bottom – and her path from imperiousness to passion was convincing.” 

Ms. Graham appears in 2015-16 as the title role in Nashville Opera’s production of *Turandot*; Wagner Galas in Mexico City at Sala Nezahualcóyotl and at Bellas Artes as Serena in *Porgy and Bess* at Toledo Opera; and in concert with the Springfield Symphony Orchestra. 

She has performed the title role of *Turandot* with Opera Carolina, Orquesta Filhamónica de la UNAM, Opera de Nuevo León, Arizona Opera, Michigan Opera Theatre, Opera Columbus, Opera Delaware, Utah Festival Opera, Connecticut Grand Opera, Pensacola Opera, Sacramento Opera, Boston’s Chorus Pro Musica, the Westfield Symphony Orchestra, and the Harrisburg Symphony. 

Most recent engagements have included the title role in *Ariadne auf Naxos* with Festival Opera; the title role in *Aida* with Opera Carolina, Toledo Opera, and at the Teatro Greco di Siracusa in Sicily; and Minnie in *La Fanciulla del West* with Nashville Opera, and Indianapolis Opera. Recent concert highlights include Beethoven’s 9th Symphony with the Philadelphia Orchestra; an all-Wagner program with the Washington Chorus at the Kennedy Center and in Lima, Peru; the Verdi *Requiem* with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and Mississippi Symphony Orchestra; Serena in *Porgy and Bess* with the Jacksonville Symphony; Isolde in *Tristan und Isolde* in Zagreb, Croatia; and the Britten *War Requiem* with the Fondazione Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi. 

Additional appearances have included Odabella in *Attila* with Sarasota Opera, the title role of *Aida* for the inaugural performance of the Istanbul International Opera Festival, Leonora in *Il Trovatore* with Utah Festival Opera, the title role in *Tosca* with Festival Opera, and the title role in *Elektra* at Philadelphia’s Academy of Vocal Arts. Emerging into the Wagnerian repertoire, Ms. Graham’s notable roles also include Senta in *Der Fliegender Holländer*, Brünnhilde and Sieglinde in Wagner’s *Ring Cycle*, and Elisabeth in *Tannhäuser*. 

Other concert highlights include a New York recital debut with the Liederkranz Society; a Wagner concert co-sponsored by the Wagner Society of Washington, D.C.; Isolde in *Tristan und Isolde* with the Young Musicians Foundation Orchestra in California; Brünnhilde excerpts from *Die Walküre* for the L’Opéra de Montréal gala; *Elijah* with Bryn Terfel and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir; a featured appearance with Eve Queler at the Dahesh Museum of Art; as well as opera galas for Pacific Opera Victoria, Vancouver Opera, Orquesta Sinfonica de Xalapa, and Canada’s Oakville Symphony.
