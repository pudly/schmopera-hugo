Praised for her rich sound and captivating finesse, soprano Jamie Groote is immensely dedicated to her artistry and is creating a reputation for herself as a young singer to watch. Regularly commended on and off the stage for her charismatic stage presence, immense palette of vocal colours, invariable work ethic and positive attitude, her reviews from the rehearsal room speak as loudly as those of her performances. Currently in her third year in the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio, Jamie has had the great privilege of world class training and performance opportunities including numerous opportunities with the Canadian Opera Company Orchestra on the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts stage in concert and in full mainstage roles.

This Toronto-native had her humble beginnings at Etobicoke School of the Arts where she majored in Music Theatre and fell in love with performing as Maria in _West Side Story_. She continued on to receive her HBMus from Wilfrid Laurier University as well as an Opera Dip. and then spent two wonderful years completing her MMus degree in the University of Toronto's affectionately named "Opera School". Jamie, then directly joined the Ensemble Studio where she remains currently. Jamie has attended numerous young artist programs including: Opera Theater of Saint Louis' Gerdine Young Artist Program, Banff Centre and Against the Grain Theatre's Opera in the 21 century, Central City Opera's Bonfils-Stanton Foundation Artist Training Program, Houston Grand Opera's YAVA, Opera NUOVA, and the Belcanto Summer Voice Program in Munich, Germany.

Most recently Jamie performed in her cinematic debut as **La Ciesca** in the Canadian Opera Company's digital production of _Gianni Schicchi_ and looks forward to the winter and spring season, when the energy of an audience will fill the Four Seasons Centre again (fingers crossed!). Pre-pandemic, Jamie made her debut on the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts' stage as a Wood Nymph in Dvorak's _Rusalka_ to great success. Groote also had the great privilege of performing as Hansel in the Opera for Young Audiences production of _Hansel and Gretel_ on the FSC stage with the COC orchestra, as well as covering the role in german last season. She also covered the role of Berta in the COC's _Il barbiere di Siviglia_.

In the 2020/21 season Jamie made the exciting decision to follow her voice into full lyric soprano repertoire and has never felt so artistically fulfilled or at home in her new repertoire. Though countless performances were cancelled during the pandemic, Jamie appreciates the time she had to uncover her most authentic instrument. Stay tuned for more upcoming season details, if you liked her as a mezzo...just you wait!
