Canadian tenor Owen McCausland is increasingly in demand for engagements with both opera companies and symphonies across North America. Highlights of recent seasons include Verdi’s Otello with the Cleveland Orchestra, Mozart’s Don Giovanni with Pacific Opera Victoria, and the premiere of Cusson’s Fantasma with the Canadian Opera Company. His 22/23 season sees returns to the Canadian Opera Company (Salome), Pacific Opera Victoria (Così fan tutte), and the Cleveland Orchestra (La Fanciulla del West). Owen also looks forward to his role debut as Lucio Silla with Opera in Concert (Toronto), the world premiere of Frehner’s LEX with Soundstreams, and Mendelssohn’s Elijah with the Grand Philharmonic Choir and Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony.

Owen enjoyed an exciting 2019-2020 season that included Lensky in Eugene Onegin for Opéra de Montréal, Rinuccio in Gianni Schicchi for Pacific Opera Victoria, and Messiah for the Okanagan Symphony. He opened the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal’s 2018-2019 season with the World Premiere of Chaakapesh, The Trickster’s Quest under the baton of Kent Nagano. Written by Tomson Highway and Matthew Ricketts, the chamber opera’s premiere was followed by an extensive tour from the Arctic to the interior of Quebec. McCausland’s season continued with Jaquino in Fidelio for Pacific Opera Victoria, Ottavio in Don Giovanni for Manitoba Opera, Roderigo in Otello for the Canadian Opera Company, Messiahs in Victoria and New Brunswick, and Mozart’s Requiem for Ottawa’s Music and Beyond. 

An alumnus of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, he has been heard at the Four Seasons’ Centre as Pedrillo in Die Entführung aus dem Serail and the Fisherman in Le Rossignol. Weill’s Sieben Todsünden for the Toronto Symphony, Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde for the Ottawa Symphony, Messiah for Symphony Nova Scotia, the London Symphonia and Regina Symphony, Tamino in Die Zauberflöte and Lurcanio in Ariodante for the Canadian Opera Company, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 for Kitchener-Waterloo’s Grand Philharmonic Choir and Regina Symphony, and Rodolfo in La bohème for Against the Grain Theatre are among recent credits.

He has also appeared in COC mainstage productions as Don Juan in Don Quichotte, Lord Cecil in Roberto Devereux, Ferrando in Così fan tutte (Ensemble Studio performance), Reverend Horace Adams in Peter Grimes and stepped in for a colleague in the title role of La clemenza di Tito for four performances.

Further credits include Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor (Pacific Opera Victoria), the title role in Werther (Chautauqua Institution), Camille in The Merry Widow (Newfoundland Symphony), and Alfred in Die Fledermaus (Guelph Symphony).
