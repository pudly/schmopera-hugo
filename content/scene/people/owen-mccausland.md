From Saint John, New Brunswick, tenor Owen McCausland is increasingly in demand for engagements with important opera companies and symphonies across Canada. He opened the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal’s 2018-2019 season with the World Premiere of _Chaakapesh, The Trickster’s Quest_ under the baton of Kent Nagano. Written by Tomson Highway and Matthew Ricketts, the chamber opera’s premiere was followed by an extensive tour from the Arctic to the interior of Quebec. McCausland’s season continued with Jaquino in _Fidelio_ for Pacific Opera Victoria, Ottavio in _Don Giovanni_ for Manitoba Opera, Roderigo in _Otello_ for the Canadian Opera Company, _Messiahs_ in Victoria and New Brunswick and Mozart’s _Requiem_ for Ottawa’s Music and Beyond.

McCausland looks forward to an exciting year ahead. Lensky in _Eugene Onegin_ for Opéra de Montréal, Rinuccio in _Gianni Schicchi_ for Pacific Opera Victoria, _Messiah_ for the Okanagan Symphony and an extension of Soundstreams’ _Musik für das Ende_ project focusing on the enigmatic work by Claude Vivier. 

An alumnus of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, his 2017-2018 schedule called for Pedrillo in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_ and the Fisherman in _Le Rossignol_ for the Canadian Opera, Weill’s Sieben Todsünden for the Toronto Symphony, Mahler’s _Das Lied von der Erde_ for the Ottawa Symphony, Vivier’s _Musik für das Ende_ for Soundstreams and Messiah for Symphony Nova Scotia and the London Symphonia. Other recent credits include Tamino in _Die Zauberflöte_ and Lurcanio in _Ariodante_ for the Canadian Opera Company, _Messiah_ with the Regina Symphony and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 for Kitchener-Waterloo’s Grand Philharmonic Choir, and Rodolfo in _La bohème_ for Against the Grain Theatre.

He has appeared in COC mainstage productions as Don Juan in _Don Quichotte_, Lord Cecil in _Roberto Devereux_, Ferrando in _Così fan tutte_ (Ensemble Studio performance), Reverend Horace Adams in _Peter Grimes_ and stepped in for a colleague in the title role of _La clemenza di Tito_ for four performances.

During the 2015/2016 season, Mr. McCausland performed as Alfredo in _La traviata_ with the University of British Columbia Ensemble and Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Testo in the Canadian Opera Company production of Monteverdi’s _Il combattimento di Tancredi_ e Clorinda, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 for the Regina Symphony and _Messiah_ for the Sudbury Symphony.

Further credits include Arturo in _Lucia di Lammermoor_ (Pacific Opera Victoria), the title role in _Werther_ (Chautauqua Institution), Camille in _The Merry Widow_ (Newfoundland Symphony), Alfred in _Die Fledermaus_ (Guelph Symphony) and Rinuccio in _Gianni Schicchi_ (Opera on the Avalon).

Mr. McCausland was a finalist and winner of the Canadian Encouragement Award at the 2015 George London Singing Competition and a semi-finalist in both the 2015 Montreal International Music Competition and 2019 Hans Gabor Belvedere International Singing Competition.   
  
Mr. McCausland holds a Bachelor of Arts in Music from Dalhousie University.
