"Blessed with a plush, dramatic voice capable of formidable power and dazzling high notes …" (_Associated Press_)

South African-born Elza van den Heever is one of the world's most important lyric-dramatic sopranos.

She opens the season 2024-25 as Leonore (_Fidelio_) at Lyric Opera Chicago. The Metropolitan Opera presents the soprano als Empress (_Frau ohne Schatten_) and as Salome in two of her signature roles. She will make her debut at La Scala Milano as Sieglinde (_Walküre_) under the baton of Christian Thielemann and appear as Elettra (_Idomeneo_) at the San Francisco Opera under Eun Sun Kim. She returns to the role of Elsa von Brabant (_Lohengrin_) at Bayreuther Festspiele, under Christian Thielemann. Concert engagements include a Strauss concert with the Metropolitan Orchestra under Yannick Nézet-Séguin at Carnegie Hall New York.

Outstanding engagements in recent seasons include the Empress under Christian Thielemann at the Vienna State Opera; her role debut as Elisabeth (_Tannhäuser_) at the MET; Chrysothemis (_Elektra_) under Kirill Petrenko at the Baden-Baden Easter Festival and in concert at the Philharmonie Berlin; her role debut as Sieglinde (_Walküre_) with the Rotterdam Philharmonic under Yannick Nézet-Séguin and Julia in Spontini's _La Vestale_ in a new production staged by Lydia Steier with Bertrand de Billy conducting.
