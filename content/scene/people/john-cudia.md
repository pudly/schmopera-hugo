John Cudia is equally at home on Opera, Theater and Concert stages. A lyric tenor, he proudly made his Lyric Opera of Chicago debut as Curly in their production of *Oklahoma!* For Vancouver Opera, John most recently sang Count Danilo in *The Merry Widow*. Previously for Vancouver Opera he sang Cassio in *Otello* and Juan Peron in *Evita*. For Indianapolis Opera, he created the role of Dr. Woodly in the World Premiere of *Happy Birthday Wanda June* by Richard Auldon Clark with Libretto by Indiana’s own Kurt Vonnegut. For Lyric Opera of the North he sang the Duke in *Rigoletto* and Alfredo in *La Traviata*.    

John, as Curly was praised by Opera News for his “naturally appealing timbre graced with an attractive, rather tenorish ring above the staff.”

"Not to be forgotten was John Cudia as Alfredo. His idyllic "De' miei bollenti spiriti" in Act 2 was his shining moment in his operatic debut. Cudia's enunciation was excellent, and more impressively his tone changed over the evening from the romantic euphoria of his "Un di, felice, eterea" to the tender regret of "Parigi, o cara, noi lasceremo." - Duluth News Tribune

 In concert, John had sung with The Baltimore Symphony, The North Carolina Symphony, The Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, The Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra, and The Detroit Symphony Orchestra all with guest conductor Stuart Chafetz; also Deer Valley Music Festival, Heartland Festival Orchestra. As one of the “three tenors” with The Orchestra Of St. Peter by the Sea. He sang with Maestro Delta David Gier and The South Dakota Symphony Orchestra.

John holds the distinct honor of being the first and only actor to have performed both as the The Phantom in *The Phantom of the Opera* and Jean Valjean in *Les Misérables* on Broadway. John’s most recent Broadway run counted him as only the 12th performer to play the Phantom in its historic, record-breaking 30+ years. John played Jean Valjean at the Marriott Theater in Chicago where his performance earned him the Joseph Jefferson Award for “best actor in a musical.” John proudly made his Broadway debut in Les Misérables and enjoyed a long and successful relationship with both "Les Miz" and "Phantom."
