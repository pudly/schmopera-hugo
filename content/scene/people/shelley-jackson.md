Shelley Jackson is a young American soprano in her second year of the International Opera Studio of Opernhaus Zürich, where this season she makes her role debuts as Musetta in a new production of *La bohème*, and Micaëla in *Carmen*. Last season as a first year studio member, she created the protagonist role of Song- Lian in the world premiere production of *Rote Laterne* by Christian Jost, conducted by Alain Altinoglu. Her performance was universally hailed as "clear, bright, and brilliant" (Tages-Anzeiger) and "offers a balance of exciting sureness and incredible force" (Opéra Magazine). Ms. Jackson was also seen as Maid Marian in *Robin Hood* and die Vertraute in *Elektra*. Her assignments in the bel canto repertoire in Zürich include the covers of Cecilia Bartoli as Countess Adele in *Le comte Ory*, Diana Damrau as Adina in *L'elisir d'amore*, and Giulietta in a new production of *I Capuleti ed i Montecchi* led by Fabio Luisi. In the upcoming season, she will make her debut at the Teatro Massimo Palermo as Micaëla in Calixto Bieto's production of *Carmen*.

Ms. Jackson made an unscheduled debut at the Santa Fe Opera as Norina in the new Laurent Pelly production of *Don Pasquale* for the opening night of the 2014 season, scoring a major success as a member of the Apprentice Program, and sang further performances to critical acclaim.

Ms. Jackson was recently named the recipient of the Joan Sutherland Prize from the Veronica Dunne Competition in 2016, chosen by Richard Bonynge. Ms. Jackson has also won second place in the Giargiari Bel Canto and the Mario Lanza Competitions, third place in the Concours International de Chant Marmandais, fifth prize in the Loren L. Zachary Vocal Competition, an encouragement award from the Gerda Lissner Foundation, and a grant from the Licia Albanese- Puccini Foundation: in which her "Tu, che di gel", showed off a good grasp of Puccini style and a vocal with a distinctive profile" (Opera News). Her past prizes also include the Bertha Koempel Award from the Liederkranz Foundation, a grant from the Career Bridges Foundation, the Nicolai Ghiaurov scholarship from the Centro Universale di Bel Canto, and she was a finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Northeast Regional Auditions.
