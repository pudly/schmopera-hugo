"The Lyric summit belonged to soprano Chelsea Rus as Lauretta. O Mio Babbino caro soared without losing its youthful spirit (and infectious six-eight metre.)" - *The Gazette*.
 
From a start in the world of jazz, Chelsea graduated with distinction from the University of British Columbia/s Opera Department where she studied with Nancy Hermiston.  She is currently in her first year of her Masters in Solo/Opera Degree at the Schulich School of Music, McGill University, in the studio of Joanne Kolomyjec.

Combined with her formal studies, Chelsea has already performed on the operatic stage and in concert work, as well as in vocal competitions.  She made her Vancouver Symphony debut singing the role of Lisa from Lehar’s *Land of Smiles* and then was given the opportunity to perform excerpts from Puccini’s *La Bohème* singing the role of Mimì.  Chelsea also had the occasion to sing with the Okanagan Symphony, once again performing the role of Mimì in excerpts from *La Boheme* and then as soprano soloist in a concert of Romantic Viennese Music.

In 2013, Chelsea performed the role of Blanche in UBC’s production of Poulenc’s *Dialogues des Carmélites* with Canada’s world renowned Mezzo Soprano Judith Forst singing the role of the Old Prioress. The summer of 2013 brought Chelsea to the Czech Republic to sing the role of Lisak in Janacek’s *Cunning Little Vixen*.

As a winner of the 2014 Johann Strauss Competition, Chelsea had the good fortune to study at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria with distinguished sopranos Helen Donath and Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her time in Salzburg gave her many performing opportunities, singing in Masterclasses and Concerts. The Summer of 2015, Chelsea will travel to Amsterdam as a finalist in the Belvedere International Competition. 

Chelsea's Opera McGill debut was Venus in John Blow’s *Venus and Adonis*, and in March 2015 she appeared as Lauretta in Puccini’s *Gianni Schicchi* with the McGill Chamber Orchestra and Maestro Boris Brott.  The summer of 2015  brought Chelsea to Kelowna, B.C. where she will be performed for the first time the role of La Contessa in Mozart’s *Le Nozze di Figaro* with Kelowna Opera.  For the 2015-2016 season at McGill, you may have seen her as Beth from Mark Adamo's *Little Women* (November 2015), or as Adina in *L'elisir d'amore* (January 2016).

Most recently, Chelsea was the winner of the Elizabeth Wirth Vocal Prize with a grand prize of $25,000. She is thrilled to be joining the Atelier Lyrique of Montréal Opera as a resident artist for their 2016-2017 season.
