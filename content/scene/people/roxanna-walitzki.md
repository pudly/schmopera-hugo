Roxanna Walitzki is an innovative performance-artist whose musical dedication, eye for beauty and unique aesthetic infuses her work with vibrancy and individuality. Trained in vocal performance at NYU and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, her musical endeavors stretch the bounds of traditional performance-practice and have been heralded as “spellbinding.”

An "operatic iconoclast," Roxanna frequently explores the expressive capabilities of art-video as a vehicle to keep classical music alive and current.  Her performances incorporate elaborate fashion as well as expressive movement.  She has begun integrating experimental elements from electronic music into her arrangements of classical songs, producing a delicate world of imagined-sound to match her uniquely ethereal aesthetic.

Roxanna's wide repertoire encompasses Baroque and Classical opera, where she specializes in travesty roles, German, French, and Russian songs, as well as Contemporary Classical Music.  Recently, she has been seen in recital at such venues as the Smith Tower, Roq La Rue Gallery, the Bemis Arts Building, and the Seattle Art Museum PACCAR Sculpture Garden, as well as with Seattle’s Opera on Tap and Vespertine Opera Theater.
