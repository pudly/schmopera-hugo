Equally acclaimed for her work on the concert stage, she has appeared at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, National Sawdust, Trinity Church on Wall Street, Washington National Cathedral, and the Opera America Center.

On the opera stage, Ms. Strickling created the role of Fanni Radnòti in the World Premiere of Tom Cipullo’s opera _The Parting_ with Music of Remembrance in Seattle and San Francisco. An alumna of the Berkshire Opera Company resident artist program, Opera News praised her performance of the Dew Fairy in Humperdinck’s _Hansel and Gretel_, "Laura Strickling offered the creamy, clear, younger-sister-of-Eva-Pogner instrument ideal for singing the role over full orchestration."  She appeared as Pamina in the Metropolitan Opera Guild's touring outreach production of _The Magic Flute_. Ms. Strickling’s operatic roles also include Countess Almaviva (_Le nozze di Figaro_), Cleopatra (_Julius Caesar_), Mimi (_La boheme_), Dinorah (_Dinorah_), Elvira (_L’Italiana in Algeri_), Josephine (_H.M.S. Pinafore_), Gretel (_Hansel and Gretel_), and Micaëla (_Carmen_). She created the role of Muriel in the world premiere of Thomas Benjamin's _The Alien Corn_ with the Peabody Opera Theater.

She received critical acclaim in the Naxos Opera Classics recording of _The Parting_ by Tom Cipullo (co-starring baritone Michael Mayes and mezzo-soprano Catherine Cook) for her, “…deeply expressive, secure voice. Her exposed highs are managed wonderfully, with notable beauty.” James Matheson’s _Times Alone_ on Yarlung Records was hailed by MusicWeb International for, “shapely, nuanced voicings and emotional urgency...a striking directness.” Glen Roven’s _The Vineyard Songs_ with pianist Michael Brofman is on New Voices, the Billboard Classical Top-Ten-selling CD.  She can also be heard on New American Song@SongFest, performing Jake Heggie’s _Edna St. Vincent Millay_ with pianist Dimitri Dover, and on The Garden: Songs and Vocal Chamber Music of Tom Cipullo, performing the landmark song cycle _Of a Certain Age_ with pianist Liza Stepanova. Her upcoming recordings include her first solo project of American art song, with pianist Joy Schreier, on the Yarlung label.

A Chicago native, Ms. Strickling is an avid traveler, having lived in Morocco, where she studied classical Arabic at the Arabic Language Institute of Fez, and Kabul, Afghanistan, where her husband was the founding chair of the Department of Law at the American University of Afghanistan. She currently makes her home in St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands.
