Konstantin Krimmel, with German-Romanian roots, first got in touch with music sining at the St. George's Choir Boys in Ulm and from this moment on, the fascination of music never left him. At the age of 21, he began his vocal studies with Prof. Teru Yoshihara, which the singer completed with distinction in 2020. In the meantime he is being coached by Tobias Truniger in Munich.

Even in his student days, Konstantin Krimmel developed a special love for the concert and lied repertoire, which he quickly expanded. He has won numerous competitions since, including the German Music Competition 2019 as well as 1st prize at the International Helmut Deutsch Lied Competition, 2nd prize at the International Singing Competition 'Das Lied' in Heidelberg and the Gian Battista Viotti International Music Competition.

Accordingly, the artist has already toured nationally and internationally. These include recitals at the Kölner Philharmonie, the Deutsche Opern Berlin, the Konzerthaus Berlin, the Oper Frankfurt, the Heidelberger Frühling, as a guest at the Schubertíada de Vilabertran, the Schubertiade in Schwarzenberg, in Madrid, in London (Wigmore Hall) and at the Lied Festival in Oxford. In 2021/2022 he will be heard in Strasbourg, Nuremberg and Hohenems, among other places.

Further fine tasks are waiting the young baritone in the oratorio field. In summer 2021, the Brahms _Requiem_ under the direction of Raphael Pichon (together with Sabine Devieilhe, soprano) him in Bordeaux and the surrounding area, an extensive tour (_Christmas Oratorio_ by J.S.Bach) with the Nederlands Kamerkoor under the direction of P.Dijkstra in December and concerts with Bach's _St. Matthew Passion_ under the direction of Ph. Herreweghe at Easter 2022.

Konstantin Krimmel will open a whole new chapter in the field of opera when he becomes a member of the Bavarian State Opera beginning in autumn 2021. There he can be seen in Strauss' _Ariadne auf Naxos_ (Harlequin), in Britten's _Peter Grimes_ (Ned Keene) and in Thomas (Matthias) by Georg Friedrich Haas in the next season. In the next few years, he will be performing major Mozart roles in particular. He also returns to the Staatstheater Wiesbaden as 'Figaro' in Mozart's _Figaro's Wedding_.

Since 2019 Konstantin Krimmel has been an exclusive artist of the French label Alpha - a recording of Handel's _Brockes Passion_ together with the Ensemble Arcangelo under Jonathan Cohen has recently been released. His first Lied CD entitled 'Saga' (Lieder and Ballads by Loewe, Schumann, Schubert, Adolf Jensen) was highly praised by Thilo Braun, _Deutschlandfunk_, among others: "At only 26 years of age, he already possesses an interpretative depth and a technical sovereignty with which he doesn’t need to fear comparison with great Lied singers in his vocal field.“
