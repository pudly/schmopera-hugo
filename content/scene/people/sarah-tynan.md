Sarah Tynan’s exceptional versatility and engaging stage presence have earned her a place in the league of elite British sopranos. She enjoys huge success in baroque, classical and contemporary repertoire, and appears regularly with leading orchestras and ensembles. Last season Tynan received rave reviews for her “mesmerising” Manon Lescaut in Henze’s *Boulevard Solitude* at Welsh National Opera, a role for which she recently received the Welsh Theatre Award for Best Female in an Opera Production.

This season, Tynan sings Merab in the Glyndebourne on Tour production of Handel *Saul* throughout the UK and in Bucharest, and Ginevra in Handel *Ariodante* with Scottish Opera. Concert engagements include *Messiah* with the Ulster Orchestra and Gabrieli Consort, Tippett *A Child of Our Time* and Orff *Carmina Burana* with the BBC Symphony, Brahms *Requiem* with the Bournemouth Symphony and London Philharmonic, Mahler Symphony No. 4 with the City of Birmingham Symphony, and Ännchen *Der Freischütz* with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. She will also participate in staged productions of Britten *Les Illuminations* at the Aldeburgh Festival, and Haydn *The Creation* for Garsington Opera.

Recent operatic highlights include the world premiere of Dai Fujikura’s *Solaris* at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Opéra de Lille and Opéra de Lausanne; both Romilda *Xerxes* and Marzelline in Calixto Bieito’s production of *Fidelio* at English National Opera, Cleopatra *Giulio Cesare* and Carrie Pipperidge *Carousel* at Opera North, Sharon Disney in the world premiere of Philip Glass *The Perfect American* at Teatro Real, Madrid and ENO, Susanna *Le nozze di Figaro* at Cincinnati Opera, Iris *Semele* at La Monnaie, Dalinda *Ariodante* at Opera de Oviedo, Servilia *La Clemenza di Tito* with the OAE, and Luigi Nono’s *Al gran sole carico d’amore* at the Salzburg Festival. At the ENO, she has also sung lead roles including Adina *Elixir of Love*, Sophie *Der Rosenkavalier*, Ilia *Idomeneo*, Zerlina *Don Giovanni*, and Tytania *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

On the concert platform, Tynan recently made her Cincinnati Symphony debut in *Carmina Burana*, which she has also sung with the BBC Philharmonic, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC National Orchestra of Wales and recorded with London Philharmonic Orchestra. She has also performed Haydn *Creation* with the London Symphony Orchestra, Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center, and the Handel & Haydn Society, Boston (recording to be released in 2016); Mahler Symphony No.8 with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and Philharmonia; *Messiah* with Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Early Opera Company; Valencienne *The Merry Widow* with the Philharmonia, Handel *Solomon* with Gabrieli Consort and Campra *Le Carnaval de Venise* with Le Concert Spirituel.
