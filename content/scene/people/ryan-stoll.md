Ryan Stoll, Bass-Baritone, is a performer displaying great promise on the opera stage both vocally and dramatically.  He is currently in his first year as a young artist with Chicago Opera Theater (COT) where he covered King René in the Chicago premier of Tchaikovsky’s _Iolanta_, while performing in the chorus.  COT’s new Vanguard Initiative gave Ryan the opportunity to cover various roles in Felicia Chen and David Simpatico’s _The Life and Death(s) of Alan Turing_, a workshop co-produced with American Lyric Theater.  Finishing up his first year in the program, he will sing in the chorus of Jake Heggie’s epic _Moby Dick_ and perform as The Magician in a Gala Preview of Stacy Garrop’s _Grand Illusion_, to be premiered in April 2020.  

Between his two seasons with COT, Ryan will join Central City Opera’s Bonfils-Stanton Apprentice Artist program, covering Mr. Flint in _Billy Budd_ and singing in the chorus.  Afterwards, he will travel to Opera Steamboat to perform the Gamekeeper in Dvořák’s _Rusalka_. 

After a refreshing summer in the Colorado mountains, Ryan will return to Chicago to make his COT role debut as Guy Cotter in _Everest_ while covering the Old Gypsy in _Aleko_. As a 2019 recipient of the American Opera Society of Chicago’s (AOSC) Lola Fletcher Award, Ryan is honored to perform at the AOSC Fall Luncheon in the stunning and historic Fortnightly Club.  Later in the season he will take part in the world premier of Dan Shore’s _Freedom Ride_, and the world premier of Stacy Garrop’s _Grand Illusion_ as The Magician.
