<p>
	Dimitri Pittas has performed on leading opera stages throughout North America and Europe, including debuts with the Bavarian State Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Royal Opera at Covent Garden, and the Canadian Opera Company. He is a graduate of the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and has been heard on the Met stage as Rodolfo in <em>La bohème</em>, Macduff in <em>Macbeth</em>, Nemorino in <em>L'Elisir d'Amore</em>, and Tamino in <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>. For his debut with Canadian Opera Company as the Duke, the Toronto Star said, "Dimitri Pittas comes off the best as the <br>
	Duke of Mantua, with a flexible voice that can express real love and shallow desire with equal conviction."

<p>
	Mr. Pittas' 2014-15 season includes engagements singing Rodolfo in <em>La bohème</em> with Opera de Paris, Opera National de Bordeaux, and Palm Beach Opera. He will also sing the title role of <em>Don Carlo</em> in a new production for Opera Philadelphia, directed by Tim Albery. Dimitri will also sing the tenor solo in Verdi's magnificent Requiem with the Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester Berlin.
