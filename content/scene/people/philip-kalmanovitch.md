A recent alumnus of the Atelier lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal, Canadian baritone Philip Kalmanovitch is quickly establishing himself across North America with his exciting voice and dynamic stage presence. The 2015-16 season sees Philip make his United States Oratorio debut in Bach's _Magnificat_ with the Fairfield County Chorale, and perform the Duruflé _Requiem_ and the Mozart _Vesperae Solennes di Confessore_ with the Huntington Choral Society. He recently made his European concert debut with the Printemps Musical de Silly in Belgium, and was Abimélech in a new production of _Samson et Dalila_ at l'Opéra de Montréal. At the l'OdeM his performances of Antonio in _Le nozze di Figaro_ and the Secret Police Agent in _The Consul_ were lauded by _Opera_, and his vibrant portrayals of Wagner in _Faust_ and the Motor Cop in _Dead Man Walking_ were singled out by critics. He also appeared in Verdi's _Rigoletto_ (Conte Ceprano), Donizetti's _Roberto Devereux_ (Il familiare), Puccini's _La Bohème_ (Sergente), and Bizet's _Docteur Miracle_ (Le podestat). He recently toured a production of _Così fan tutte_ as Guglielmo with Jeunesses Musicales Canada, and made his US opera debut as Schaunard in _La Bohème_ with the Green Mountain Opera Festival in Vermont. Other roles in his repertoire include the title role in _Don Giovanni_, _Le chat noir/L’horloge comtoise_ in _L’enfant et les sortilèges_, Junius in _The Rape of Lucretia_, Marcello in _La Bohème_, Belcore in _L'elisir d'amore_, Ben in _The Telephone_, and Ramiro in _L'Heure Espagnole_.

Active in oratorio and concert, Philip has appeared as a soloist with the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal under the baton of Kent Nagano, the Fairfield Country Chorale, the Grand Philharmonic Choir, Ottawa Choral Society, Toronto Orpheus Choir, Chorus Niagara, the Annex Singers, the Virginia Tech Vocal Arts and Music Festival, The Aldeburgh Connection (Bayfield Festival of Song and Discovery Series), La choeur les voix de la montagne, VIVA Youth Choir, and The Bach Festival. He has twice performed Poulenc’s _Le bal masqué_ under the baton of Paul Nadler. Philip also recently returned to Kingston to sing with the Kingston Symphony in their presentation of _The Masque of the Red Death_, a new Canadian opera. He is especially proud to have premiered two oratorios in Canada: James MacMillan’s _Mass_, and Nils Lindberg’s _A Christmas Cantata_. He has been heard on CBC Radio, Radio-Canada, and Classical 96.3 FM, and seen on NBC News in Virginia. Outside of opera, Philip has appeared in dozens of plays and musicals, including his professional debut for the Thousand Islands Playhouse. He is a founding and performing member of Open Corps Theatre, a Toronto –based collaborative theatre company which produced successful runs of _Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris_ and Stravinsky’s _A Soldier’s Tale_.

Before undertaking studies with his current voice teacher Ronald Raines, Philip completed his Diploma in Operatic Performance with Honours at the University of Toronto where he studied with Jo-Anne Bentley. He also holds a B.A.H. in Drama and a B.A.Minor in Music from Queen’s University, studying voice with Bruce Kelly. In 2011 he received the Galaxie Musique Rising Star Award, the IVAI Silverman Scholarship, and a Canada Council for the Arts Travel Grant. Philip received an Honourable Mention from the Ottawa Choral Society New Discoveries Series in 2012 and 2014. He was awarded the Prix Lyrique Allemand and the Prix Lyrique Giuseppe Verdi-Raoul Blouin from Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques, of which he is a three-time laureate. Philip is an alumnus of the Banff Centre for the Arts, the International Vocal Arts Institute (Virginia, Tel Aviv, and Montreal), the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, the Queen of Puddings Songs and Scenes Program, and received training in an exchange with the Bayerische Staatsoper Opernstudio. He was a Sidgwick Scholar for the Toronto Orpheus Choir under the direction of Robert Cooper, was a soloist at Trinity St. Paul’s in Toronto, and is currently a soloist at the historic First Presbyterian Church in New York City.
