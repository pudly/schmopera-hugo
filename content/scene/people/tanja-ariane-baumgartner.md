Tanja Ariane Baumgartner made her debut at Covent Garden in the summer of 2013, singing Clairon in Strauss*Cappriccio*, which was followed by Judith in Bartok's *Bluebeard’s Castle* at the Edinburgh Festival. She made her debut at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in May 2014, with Brangaene, and, during the 2014/15 season, will appear at the Hamburg State Opera and Konzertverein in Vienna for the first time. 

During the 2013/14 season at Oper Frankfurt, where she has been a member of the ensemble since 2009/10, she sang the Foreign Princess (*Rusalka*), Iocaste (*Oedipe*), the extremely demanding role of Tigrana (Puccini’s *Edgar*), Charlotte (*Werther*) and Gaea (*Daphne*). Frankfurt’s 2014/15 season began with the world premiere of Rolf Riehm’s* Sirens* in which she sang Circe, and ends with her singing the Witch in Humperdinck’s *Königskinder*. Other roles with which she has enjoyed great success in Frankfurt have included Cornelia (*Giulio Cesare in Egitto*), the Princess of Bouillon (*Adriana Lecouvreur*),  Eboli (*Don Carlo*), Fricka (*Rheingold* and *Walküre*), Gora in the first performances in Germany of Reimann’s *Medea* (available on CD –OehmsClassics), Emilia (*Otello*), Fenena (*Nabucco*) and The Nurse (*Die Frau ohne Schatten*). Her bel canto technique and natural affinity for highly dramatic roles earned her enormous success and international acclaim for the title role in Othmar Schoeck’s *Penthesilea* at Theater Basel. This production, voted „Production of the Year 2008“ by Opernwelt magazine, was later seen at Oper Frankfurt where Tanja Ariane Baumgartner, once again, enjoyed a triumph. 

She made her Salzburg debut in 2010, singing Geschwitz in *Lulu*, returning in 2012 for Charlotte in Zimmermann’s *Soldaten*. Recent engagements have included two role debuts: Amneris in *Aida* and Carmen, both directed by Calixto Bieito at Theater Basel, *Eugene Onegin* at Opéra Marseille, The Nurse (*Die Frau ohne Schatten*) at De Vlaamse Opera, Santuzza (*Cavalleria rusticana*) at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein and AscheMOND, or the Fairy Queen at the Staatsoper in Berlin. 

Tanja Baumgartner also enjoys a busy concert career: she recently sang Berlioz *Les nuits d`été* and in Verdi’s *Requiem* in Frankfurt’s Alte Oper. A recording of Mahler II with the Stuttgart Philharmonic is due for release soon. 

She was under contract to Lucerne Opera from 2002-08. She studied in Karlsruhe and then with Helena Lazarska at the Vienna Conservatoire, and has been working with Alexandrina Milcheva since 2002.
