Canadian/American Soprano Eliza Johnson has been praised for her fine acting prowess and even lyric tone.  She was most recently seen as Pamina/Second Lady with the Opera Lyra Ottawa’s Opera Studio production of *The Magic Flute* (11/14) and competed as the only soprano finalist in the 2014 COC Centre Stage Competition.
 
Eliza holds a Bachelor of Music and Masters of Music in Opera from the University of Toronto where she studied with Canadian Soprano Mary Morrison and Dr. Darryl Edwards.
 
Roles with the U of T Opera Division include Lucy in *The Telephone*, Despina in *Così fan tutte*, Rob Ford’s Mother in *Rob Ford: The Opera*, Adina in *L’elisir d’amore*, and Governess in *The Turn of the Screw*. In concert, Eliza has been heard with the University of Toronto Symphony Orchestra (Beethoven’s Mass in C), Stratford Symphony Orchestra (Mozart’s *Exultate, Jubilate!*), Stratford Summer Music Concert Series, and Salon 21 with Soundstreams International. Eliza was a member of COC Chorus during the 2013-14 season.
 
In 2014, Eliza appeared as an Artist in Residence and as a Gerdine Young Artist with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis making her company debut as Soeur Valentine in *Dialogues of the Carmelites* and covering Adina in *The Elixir of Love* during their 2014 season.
 
This summer, Eliza returns to Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as a this year’s Gaddes Festival Artist for their 40th anniversary season, appearing as Berta in Michael Shell’s hilarious and dynamic production of *The Barber of Seville*, conducted by Maestro Ryan McAdams.  Eliza will also cover the role of Pulcheria in the U.S. premiere performance of Handel’s *Riccardo Primo*. While in Saint Louis, Eliza will appear as Fiordiligi (*Cosi fan tutti*) and Antonia (*Les Contes d’Hoffmann*) in excerpts with the Saint Louis Symphony, under the baton of Maestro Stephen Lord in an anniversary concert of operatic ensembles featuring the Gerdine Young Artists of OTSL 2015. Later this summer, Eliza will sing Susanna in *Le Nozze di Figaro* with Highlands Opera Studio.
 
Eliza is an alumnus of training programs with Highlands Opera Studio, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Queen of Puddings Music Theatre, Tapestry New Opera, University of Manitoba Contemporary Opera Lab, St.Andrews by the Sea, and the Oratorio Advanced Workshop with the Victoria Conservatory.  In 2009, Eliza released her debut album, “Eliza Sings Rodgers and Hart", thanks to the generous sponsorship of Mr. William Francis.
