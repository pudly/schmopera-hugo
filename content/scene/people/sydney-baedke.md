Noted as a "rising star to watch" by _Opera Canada_, soprano Sydney Baedke has been described as possessing a voice of "exquisite lyricism" (_The Guardian_) and "impressive richness" (_London
Unattached_). She began her vocal training at age five in her native Alberta and has since made emerging artist appearances across Canada, the United States, and Europe. At once praised for her "shimmering coloratura" (_Opera News_) and her vocal "roundness & warmth" (_Le Devoir_), she is making a name for herself as an artist of versatility in a wide breadth of repertoire.

The 2023-24 season sees Sydney make debuts at Carnegie Hall, the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra as the soprano soloist in Bruckner's _Te Deum_, and Pacific Opera Victoria for her role debut as Contessa Almaviva in _Le Nozze di Figaro_. She also appears with Orchestre Philharmonique et Choeur des Mélomanes for her return to Maison Symphonique as the soprano soloist in Beethoven's 9th Symphony and The Brott Music Festival & Orchestre Classique de Montréal for their respective _Messiahs_, and recently won first prize in the 2023 Rumbold Vocal Prize competition, hosted by Edmonton Opera. 

Sydney's 2022-23 season comprised of successful role & company debuts, including London's Royal Opera House in Oliver Mears' critically acclaimed production of _The Rape of Lucretia_ co-produced with Britten Pears Arts, for which she was praised for her "passionate & hauntingly sad" and "unmistakably moving" portrayal of the Female Chorus (_Plays to See_, _Opera Today_), as well as her debut as Musetta in _La bohème_ with Orchestre Philharmonique et Choeur des Mélomanes at Montreal's Maison Symphonique, for which she was hailed as a "revelation" for her "agile & seductive voice, projected with notorious assurance, strength, & efficiency". (_Le Devoir_, Atuvu.ca) Additional engagements included debuts with the Aldeburgh Festival, where she premiered a recently discovered work by Benjamin Britten through her ongoing young artist partnership with Britten Pears Arts, the Rockport Chamber Music Festival, and her role debut as Mimì (_La bohème_) with ICAV & Orchestre Classique de Montréal.

Named one of Canada's top emerging musicians under 30 by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Sydney spent the 2021 summer season as a member of the renowned Apprentice Program for Singers at the Santa Fe Opera, where she covered Tatyana in _Eugene Onegin_ and appeared as Antonia in an excerpt from _Les Contes d'Hoffmann_ in the annual Apprentice Scenes Showcase. Additional Canadian engagements saw Sydney star in the title role of Brott Opera's digital, abridged production of Estacio's iconic Canadian opera, _Filumena_, as well as her debut at Opera on the Avalon as Beatrice in Heggie's
_Three Decembers_. She made her professional debut in 2019 as La Fortuna & Valletto in Tim Albery's
critically acclaimed production of Monteverdi's _The Coronation of Poppea_ at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, where she also covered Gilda in _Rigoletto_ as a member of the Gerdine Young Artist Program. In the same season she joined the The Rebanks Fellowship Program at Toronto's Royal Conservatory of Music, through which she made Toronto concert debuts at Koerner Hall, the Canadian Opera Company, the 21C Music Festival, and the National Ballet of Canada. 

Additional operatic engagements include Marguerite (_Faust_), Calisto (_La Calisto_), Donna Anna (_Don Giovanni_), Lauretta (_Gianni Schicchi_), Malwina (_Der Vampyr_), and Johanna (_Sweeney Todd_). 

Sydney is an alumnus of prestigious opera training programs at the Aspen Music Festival, the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, Brott Opera, the Banff Centre for the Performing Arts, and was an inaugural member of Manitoba Opera’s Digital Emerging Artist Program. Sydney is a Regional Finalist & three-time prize winner at the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, and she is immensely grateful for the support of the Alberta Government, the Sylva Gelber Music Foundation, the Art Song Foundation of Canada, and the Weston Family Foundation.
