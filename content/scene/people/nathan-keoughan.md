Canadian Baritone Nathan Keoughan has been noted as having “thrilling, virile sound”(Schmopera), as well as a “charismatic and multi dimensional stage presence”(Opera Canada). The young Prince Edward Island native received his Bachelor of Music from the University of Prince Edward Island and his Masters in Voice from the New England Conservatory in Boston. He is a recent graduate of L’Opéra de Montréal’s young artist programme L’Atelier Lyrique as well as the Calgary Opera’s emerging artist program.

Recently Nathan made his American debut at Cincinnati Opera as Pink in _Another Brick in the Wall_; based on Pink Floyd’s iconic album _The Wall_. As Pink, Mr. Keoughan was praised for his “commanding presence in this marathon leading role, singing for nearly the opera’s duration.” He will be reprising the role at the Sony Centre in Toronto and Vancouver Opera in the 2019/2020 season.
