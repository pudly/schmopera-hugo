Baritone Nathan Keoughan is a rising star to watch, with a budding international career already recognizing him as a dynamic singing actor. Praised for his “booming, rich voice”, Keoughan has been lauded for his “charismatic, frightening, and empathetic” performances (Broadway World). 

Born in the countryside of Prince Edward Island to a musical family, Nathan studied voice at the University of Prince Edward Island before joining the New England Conservatory in Boston. Nathan had his operatic start as an emerging artist in Calgary Opera’s McPhee Artist Development program, followed by two seasons with l’Opéra de Montréal’s Atelier lyrique. Nathan was also a finalist in the Canadian Opera Company Centre Stage Competition.

During his tenure with the Atelier Lyrique, Nathan was given the opportunity to cover the role of Pink in l’Opéra de Montréal’s premiere of Another Brick in the Wall, based on the iconic Pink Floyd album. Within the next year, Nathan appeared as Pink in the work’s U.S. premiere with Cincinnati Opera, marking his American company debut. Mr. Keoughan was praised for his “commanding presence in this marathon leading role, singing for nearly the opera’s duration” (Bachtrack). In 2019, he reprised the role in Toronto at the Meridian Hall for a sold out run. Nathan was scheduled to perform Pink in 2020, continuing this successful run of ABITW, with Vancouver Opera, Michigan Opera Theatre, and Brott Opera, all of which were regretfully cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
