Baritone Nathan Keoughan is a rising star to watch. Praised for his "booming, rich voice", this fine singing actor has been lauded for his "charismatic, frightening and empathetic" performances (Broadway World). Nathan's 2023-24 season includes his Vancouver Opera debut as Escamillo in _Carmen_, Bernstein's _MASS_ with Chorus Niagara, a role and company debut as Danilo in )The Merry Widow) with Toronto Operetta Theatre and covering the lead role of Karl Gustav in the world premiere of Bilodeau's _La reine garçon_ at Opéra de Montréal. 

Nathan’s 2022-23 season began with his first Verdi role, covering Conte di Luna in Opéra de Montréal's _Il trovatore_ and later in the season he sang triple roles (Adler/Rabe/Zeus) in Pacific Opera Victoria's production of Braunfels' _Die Vögel_. He also joined Sound the Alarm’s tour of Music of the Night in celebration of the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in the spring of 2023. 

Nathan got his operatic start as an emerging artist in Calgary Opera's young artist program followed by two seasons at l'Opéra de Montréal's professional training program l'Atelier lyrique. While there, Nathan was given the opportunity to cover the role of Pink in Opéra de Montréal's new creation _Another Brick in the Wall_ based on the iconic Pink Floyd album, The Wall. The next year Nathan took over the starring role, making his American debut with Cincinnati Opera as the jaded rockstar. In those performances, Mr. Keoughan was praised for his "commanding presence in this marathon leading role, singing for nearly the opera's duration" (Bachtrack). In 2019 he reprised the role in Toronto at the Meridian Hall and was scheduled to sing further performances at Vancouver Opera, Michigan Opera Theatre, and Brott Opera, all of which were regretfully cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   

Other opera performance highlights include: Leo Stein in Twenty-Seven with l'Atelier lyrique, Paris in Roméo et Juliette and Sciarrone in _Tosca_ with l'Opéra de Montréal, Silvio in _Pagliacci_ with Semaine Italienne Festival, and Escamillo in _Carmen_ with Orchestre symphonique de Longueuil. Born into a musical family on Prince Edward Island, the young baritone studied voice at University of Prince Edward Island before joining the New England Conservatory in Boston.
