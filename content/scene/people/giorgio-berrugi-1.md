Nominated by Placido Domingo as one of his heirs, Giorgio Berrugi is one of the most appreciated tenors of today for his unmistakable, warm Italian sound, his exceptional musicality and the expressive nuances of his interpretations.

Berrugi has performed in the most important opera houses, auditoriums and music festivals such as the Teatro alla Scala, Royal Opera House in London, Lincoln Center in New York, Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Théâtre des Champs–Élysées in Paris, Deutsche Oper in Berlin, San Francisco Opera, Gewandhaus in Leipzig, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Suntory Hall in Tokyo, Wigmore Hall in London, Parco della Musica in Rome and Arena di Verona. He has worked with great conductors such as Zubin Mehta, Christian Thielemann, Fabio Luisi, Andriss Nelsons, Gustavo Dudamel, Daniel Oren, Gianandrea Noseda, Pinchas Steinberg, Nicola Luisotti, Myung-Whun Chung, Manfred Honeck, Roberto Abbado and Jaap van Zweden.

Recent engagements have included _La Bohème_ of the 120th anniversary at Teatro Regio in Turin, _Simon Boccanegra_ at Teatro alla Scala in Milan and at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, _Roméo et Juliette_ at Arena di Verona, _Un Ballo in Maschera_ at the Bolshoi in Moscow, _Der Rosenkavalier_ at the Royal Opera House in London and performances as a soloist in Verdi’s _Requiem_ in New York with the London Symphony Orchestra, in Milan with Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala, at Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris, in Rome for Accademia di Santa Cecilia, in Lucerne, Hong Kong, Manchester, Dallas, Valencia and Riga.

Before becoming a singer, Berrugi graduated with honors in clarinet. He won major international awards both as a soloist and in chamber music and was the first clarinet of the Orchestra Sinfonica di Roma for five years.

He began his vocal studies in 2007 and after a few months he debuted as Rodolfo in _La Bohème_ at Teatro La Fenice in Venice. From 2010 to 2013 he was a member of the ensemble of Dresden Semperoper, where he performed many important roles such as Don José in _Carmen_, Riccardo in _Un Ballo in Maschera_, Mario Cavaradossi in _Tosca_, Nemorino in _L’elisir d’amore_, the Duke of Mantua in _Rigoletto_ and Gennarino in the world première of _Gisela_, the last opera written by Hans Werner Henze.

His plans in the 2018/2019 season include _La Traviata_ at the Lyric Opera in Chicago, _La Damnation de Faust_ in Frankfurt, _Madama Butterfly_ at Opéra National de Paris, Mahler’s _8th Symphony_ with the Wiener Philarmoniker, _Rigoletto_ in Palermo directed by John Turturro, _L’elisir d’amore_ in Turin and _La Bohème_ in Naples.
