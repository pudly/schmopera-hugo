Soprano Angela Mortellaro possesses a captivating stage presence and consistently delivers in a wide range of characters and vocal demands. She has sung leading roles in *Lucia di Lammermoor*, *Roméo et Juliette*, *Thaïs*, *La Traviata*, *L’elisir d’amore*, and has created roles in new operas including Charlie Parker’s *Yardbird*, *Silent Night* and *The Manchurian Candidate*.
 
This season, Angela will debut Micaëla in *Carmen* with Central City Opera, and Susanna in Mozart’s *Le nozze di Figaro* with Minnesota Opera. She will be featured as Soprano Soloist with the Dayton Philharmonic presenting Ralph Vaughan Williams *A Sea Symphony*. Additionally, Angela will debut with Chicago Opera Theater in a double bill of Donizetti’s works, *Il Pigmalione* and *Rita*: his first work and one of his last. She will sing Galatea in *Il Pigmalione* and the title role in *Rita*.
 
Engagements in the 2016-2017 season included two exciting role debuts: Juliette in Gounod’s *Roméo et Juliette* with the Minnesota Opera, and Norina in *Don Pasquale* with the Sarasota Opera. 

Ms. Mortellaro also reprised the role of Doris Parker in Charlie Parker’s *Yardbird* with both Madison Opera and Lyric Opera of Chicago’s Lyric Unlimited.
 
The summer of 2015 brought a memorable role debut as Adina in Donizetti’s *L’elisir d’amore* with the Dorset Opera Festival in Dorset, England. Other engagements during the 2015-2016 season included both Musetta in *La Boheme* and Despina in *Cosí fan tutte* with Sarasota Opera, and Fiorilla in Rossini’s *Il Turco in Italia* with Opera Southwest. Angela starred in a premier of *The Book Collector*, a one-act opera by composer Stella Sung and librettist Ernest Hilbert, performed as a prequel to a fully-staged *Carmina Burana* featuring the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance. She was featured in the role of Anna and as the Soprano Soloist.

The soprano completed two other exciting World Premier productions in 2015: the role of Doris Parker, wife of Charlie Parker, in Opera Philadelphia’s *Charlie Parker’s Yardbird* and Jocie in Minnesota Opera’s production of *The Manchurian Candidate*. *The Manchurian Candidate* is the second opera by composer Kevin Puts and librettist Mark Campbell, the team that created the Pulitzer Prize winning work *Silent Night*.  
 
Other performances of note: Gretel in *Hansel and Gretel* with the Minnesota Opera, Violetta in *La Traviata* for Opera North, Anna in *Nabucco* with Opera Philadelphia, Adele in *Die Fledermaus* with Sarasota Opera, and Jean Acker in Dominic Argento’s *The Dream of Valentino* with the Minnesota Opera.

She has appeared in recital with the Artist Series of Sarasota, and as a soloist in Galas presented by Opera Orlando and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.

While a Resident Artist with the Minnesota Opera, Ms. Mortellaro sang numerous leading and secondary roles. She sang a “saucy, hammy” and “foxy” Despina in *Così fan tutte*, garnering high praise for her portrayal as the sister’s maid.  While there she also performed Madeleine Audebert and covered Anna Sorenson in the company’s World Premiere of Kevin Puts' *Silent Night*. She sang Sophie in *Werther* for Minnesota Opera’s first ever web broadcast portraying her character with a "welcoming lightness and physicality." Her debut as Lucia in *Lucia di Lammermoor* proved to be the highlight of her experience as a Resident Artist with the company.  Additionally, Ms. Mortellaro performed as Amore in *Orfeo ed Eurydice* alongside countertenor David Daniel and the renowned St. Paul Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Harry Bicket while in Minnesota. 
 
Among her first professional opera experiences, Ms. Mortellaro performed Gretel in *Hansel and Gretel* for both the Sarasota Opera and Opera Maine, and again enjoyed high marks for her performances. She currently resides in Chicago, IL.
