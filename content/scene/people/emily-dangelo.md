A 2020 Lincoln Center Emerging Artist, Emily D’Angelo is the first and only vocalist to have been presented with the Leonard Bernstein Award from the Schleswig Holstein Festival, and has been named one of WQXR NYC Public Radio’s "40 Under 40" singers to watch, and Canada's "Top 30 Under 30" Classical Musicians.  

The 2021/22 season marks numerous exciting debuts for D’Angelo.  She begins the season with her role and house debut as Ottavia (_L'Incoronazione di Poppea_) at Zurich Opera, before making a house and role  debut as Angelina in Rossini’s _La Cenerentola_ at Semperoper Dresden. At the Metropolitan Opera New York, Emily D'Angelo stars as Prince Charming in _Cinderella_ before returning to Teatro alla Scala in Milano for yet another role debut, Donna Elvira in _Don Giovanni_, and closes the season with a house and role debut at Paris Opera as Siebel in Gounod's _Faust_.

A sought-after concert performer, Emily D'Angelo makes her debut in Salzburg where she sings the opening concert at the Mozartwoche Festival.  She returns to Prague for a Bel Canto program at the Dvořák Hall alongside Hera Hyesang Park and Petr Nekorenec, can be heard in recital with pianist Sophia Muñoz at the Stockholm National Philharmonic Concert Hall, and joins Rolando Villazón in concert at the Luxembourg Philharmonie.  With the English Concert Orchestra,  D'Angelo tours through the U.S. and Europe with stops in New York (Carnegie Hall), London, Pamplona and Madrid in a debut as the titular role in Handel’s _Serse_ before appearing in a gala programme in Oviedo with Olga Kulchynska.

Highlights of the previous season include a "barnstorming role and house debut as Sesto" (_La clemenza di Tito_) at the Royal Opera House in London, performances as Idamante (_Idomeneo_) and Cherubino (_Le nozze di Figaro_) at the Bavarian State Opera, as well as her house debut at Teatro alla Scala as Dorabella (_Cosí fan tutte_).  At the Berlin State Opera, she performed as Cherubino under the baton of Maestro Daniel Barenboim.  In addition to these live-streamed opera performances from Milan, Berlin, Munich, and London, she also presented a recorded recital program for the Kennedy Center Vocal Arts DC recital series and Deutsche Grammophon Stage series with pianist Sophia Muñoz. 

D’Angelo’s debut season on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera New York included performances of Annio (_La clemenza di Tito_), Second Lady (_The Magic Flute_), and Soeur Mathilde (_Dialogues des Carmélites_). The 2018-19 season also included a return to the Canadian Opera Company for her role debut as Dorabella, and company debuts with Berlin State Opera as Cherubino, and the Santa Fe Opera as Dorabella.  In 2020 D’Angelo returned to the Canadian Opera Company as Rosina (_Il barbiere di Siviglia_), a role in which she debuted at the 2018 Glimmerglass Festival in a new production by Francesca Zambello.  D'Angelo made her stage debut as Cherubino at the Spoleto Festival dei Due Mondi, where she was awarded the 2016 Monini Prize.

From 2016 to 2018 D'Angelo won first prize in numerous international competitions including the Metropolitan Opera Competition, the Canadian Opera Company Competition, the George London Competition, the Gerda Lissner Competition, the Innsbruck Baroque Competition, and the Operalia Competition where a historic win included First Prize, the Zarzuela Prize, the Birgit Nilsson Prize and Audience Prize.

Her critically acclaimed debut album _energeia_, with music from the 12th and 21st centuries by the composers Hildegard von Bingen, Hildur Guðnadóttir, Missy Mazzoli and Sarah Kirkland Snider, is described by the artist herself as a "a soundworld, bound together by the multi-sensory ancient concept of enargeia." It was named one of the 50 best albums of 2021 by NPR, the best Canadian classical album of 2021 by the CBC, and was featured on NPR's 100 best songs of 2021.
