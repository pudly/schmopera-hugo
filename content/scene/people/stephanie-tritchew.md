Canadian mezzo soprano Stephanie Tritchew (she-her) is a steadily rising young singer, at home in the realms of both contemporary and standard repertoire. She has been named “one of six Canadian women making the future bright for the art form” by The Globe and Mail.` Stephanie’s recent work includes diverse repertoire with companies including Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Vancouver Opera, Calgary Opera, Edmonton Opera, as well as a host of independent companies and projects. This season, Stephanie debuts with Regina Symphony Orchestra and Niagara Symphony Orchestra as the Alto Soloist in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, and will return to Edmonton Opera for a role debut of Dorabella in Mozart’s Così fan tutte. 

In a year devastated by COVID-19, Stephanie debuted in Vancouver Opera’s digital season in Amahl and the Night Visitors, and was complimented on “capturing the angst of a late teenager” in her role debut as Cherubino in Edmonton Opera’s Le nozze di Figaro (Edmonton Journal). Stephanie’s grounded practice complements her vocal facility, and has earned her a burgeoning reputation for dynamic, captivating performance on stage. As Stéphano for Calgary Opera’s Roméo et Juliette she was hailed as “fun, and even coquettish” (Opera Canada), and she was “scintillating” as Rosina in Opera 5’s Il barbiere di Siviglia (Ludwig van Toronto). 

Her deep commitment to the vibrant future of opera is evident in the many times she has been an integral part in the creation of new works. Roles include The Friend in Requiem for a Lost Girl with Vancouver Opera, the Mystic Blindwoman (cover) in Shalimar the Clown at Opera Theatre Saint Louis, and Birgitta in Bandits in the Valley with Tapestry Opera. She created the role of Union Organizer in Sweat with The Bicycle Opera Project, wherein she was hailed for a performance embodying her character’s “quality of desperation” within an entirely a capella score (Opera Ramblings). 

Stephanie’s entrancing stage presence also translates to her concert work. She has sung the Alto Soloist in Handel’s Messiah with both Chorus Niagara and the Vancouver Bach Choir, Alto Soloist in Honegger’s Le Roi David with Chorus Niagara and in Agócs’ Vessel with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Bramwell Tovey. Stephanie was awarded a 2021 Lobstick Foundation Bursary. She was a member of Vancouver Opera’s Yulanda M. Faris Young Artist Program, Calgary Opera’s Emerging Artist Program, and had tenure as Gerdine Young Artist with the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis in both the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Stephanie holds a BMus and MMus from Western University and an Opera Diploma from the University of Toronto.
