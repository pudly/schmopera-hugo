An alumna of the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme, Russian soprano Vlada Borovko became a member of the programme at the start of the 2015/16 season, immediately upon her graduation from the Kazan State Conservatory.
Shortly after joining the program, she made an impressive debut as Violetta Valery on the main stage of Royal Opera House, when she was called at the last moment to step in for an ailing colleague. The event marked not only her debut in the role but also her stage debut in a leading role. Since then she has appeared in productions of *Norma*, *L'elisir d'amore* and *Boris Godunov*, as well as taking on the role of Aspasia in Royal Opera House's acclaimed production of *Mitridate, Re di Ponto*.

Current highlights include a return to the Royal Opera House as a guest artist to debut the role of Musetta *La bohème*, company debuts at Oper Köln and Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe as Violetta *La traviata*, a role and house debut as Adalgisa *Norma* at Teatro Municipal de Santiago de Chile as well as her first Mimi *La bohème* in Stuttgart.

Further role assignments whilst on the Young Artists Programme at the Royal Opera House included Frasquita *Carmen*, Xenia in a new production of *Boris Godunov* which was also presented at the BBC Proms, Anna *Nabucco*, Clotilde *Norma*, Ermione *Oreste*, Mlle Jouvenot *Adriana Lecouvreur*, and Giannetta *L'elisir d'amore*.

On the concert platform she performed Verdi's *Requiem* at the Grange Festival as part of their inaugural season and was a finalist in Placido Domingo's prestigious 2017 Operalia competition.

Borovko initially went on to study foreign languages at the Linguistics University of Nizhny Novgorod. Upon her graduation she enrolled at the Kazan State Conservatory where she studied under the guidance of Galina Lastovka. While still a student, she was invited to take part in the world premieres of two contemporary works and sang Stephano *Roméo et Juliette* in Kazan. She made her professional opera debut as Mércèdes *Carmen* at Tatar State Opera and Ballet Theatre and sang Annie and Strawberry Woman *Porgy and Bess* with Marco Boemi at the International Shalyapin Opera Festival.
