Praised by Opera News for “high notes with ease, singing with a luxuriant warm glow that seduced the ear as he bounded about the stage with abandon,” American tenor David Portillo has established himself as a leading classical singer of his generation.

In the 2019-2020 season, he will return to the Metropolitan Opera to debut the role of Steuermann in a new production of _Der fliegende Holländer_, conducted by Valery Gergiev and opposite Bryn Terfel, the Metropolitan Opera and Washington National Opera for performances of Tamino in _Die Zauberflöte_, Bayerische Staatsoper as Pasquale in _Orlando Paladino_, and Mr. Rodriguez in the world-premiere of _Awakenings_ by Tobias Picker at Opera The atre of St. Louis. David Portillo’s 2018-2019 season included a return to the Metropolitan Opera for a role debut as the Chevalier de la Force in _Dialogues des Carmélites_, a return to the Lyric Opera of Chicago for Arbace in _Idomeneo_ with Sir Andrew Davis, an opera he performed for his debut with the Teatro Real in Madrid, but as Idamante, and finally, Oper Frankfurt and the Glyndebourne Festival as Tamino.

On two separate occasions in the season, Mr. Portillo returned to his hometown of San Antonio, Texas for a role debut as Alfredo in _La traviata_ with Opera San Antonio, as well as a solo orchestral program of Italian repertoire with the San Antonio Symphony with Sebastian Lang-Lessing.

Orchestral engagements included a return to the Los Angeles Philharmonic for Beethoven’s Mass in C Major, and Haydn’s _Lord Nelson Mass_ with Gustavo Dudamel, an appearance with Grant Gershon and the Los Angeles Master Chorale for Mozart’s _Requiem_, and _Carmina Burana_ with DePaul University as part of the opening celebrations of the Holtschneider Performance Center.

Finally, he joined the Minnesota Orchestra for performances of Bach’s _Christmas Oratorio_, the New York Choral Society for Tippett’s _A Child of our Time_ at Carnegie Hall, the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis for Handel’s _Messiah_, and El Paso Choral Society for first performances of Verdi’s _Requiem_.

In the 2017-2018 season, David Portillo made a splash in two role debuts at the Metropolitan Opera, first as Eduardo in Thomas Adès’ North American premiere of _The Exterminating Angel_, then as Camille de Rosillon in _The Merry Widow_.

He performed Count Almaviva in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ with Houston Grand Opera, and Don Ottavio in _Don Giovanni_ for his debut with Dallas Opera.

In the summer of 2018, Mr. Portillo made two important house debuts, at the Deutsche Oper Berlin as Count Libenskof, and the Bayerische Staatsoper as Pasquale in _Orlando Paladino_. Orchestral highlights of the season included Mozart’s _Requiem_ with Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl.
