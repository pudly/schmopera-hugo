His catalogue includes musicals, chamber operas, film and theatre scores, pieces for solo instruments and ensembles, vocal and choral works, spoken word compositions, and concert-length multidisciplinary works.

	Kieren's musical dramas — seen by thousands of people throughout Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom — have been called "brilliant" (Mark Kanny, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review), "a new kind of musical theater…smart and moving" (Andy Druckenbrod, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette), and "a new, stunning body of story and sound, that left me deeply satisfied and piqued" (Sequenza21). In additional to being perennial audience favourites, these works have garnered many critical awards, including Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Production for Young Audiences (NOW Magazine), Top Ten Concerts in Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2006 and 2008), and a Total Theatre Award nomination (Total Theatre Edinburgh).
