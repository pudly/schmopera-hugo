Korean American tenor Adam Diegel regularly earns international acclaim for his impassioned dramatic sensibilities, powerful voice, and for his classic leading man looks. From a performance as Cavaradossi in _Tosca_ at Glimmerglass Opera, _Opera News_ raved: “The opera became a showdown between Adam Diegel’s impulsive, shaggily handsome Cavaradossi and Lester Lynch’s fearsome, animalistic Scarpia… (Diegel’s) spacious, Italianate tenor…delivered a stirring ‘Recondita armonia’ and built ‘E lucevan le stelle’ masterfully from hushed intimacy to an unfettered cri de coeur.”

This season Mr. Diegel will make his Boston Lyric Opera debut as Turiddu in _Cavalleria Rusticana_ and will debut with Opera Columbus singing Cavaradossi in _Tosca_, as well as a gala concert with Knoxville Opera.

The 2020-2021 Adam Diegel returned to the Pensacola Opera for Don Jose in _Carmen_ as well as making his role and company debut singing Manrico in _Il Trovatore_ with Opera Tampa, as well as joining New York City Opera in their Bryant Park concert series and debuting with Victoria Hall Opera in their concert series.

For the 2019-2020 season Mr. Diegel returned to the Metropolitan Opera as Froh in _Das Rheingold_. He made a role debut singing Narraboth in _Salome_ with the Atlanta Opera, the Tenor soloist in Mahler's _Lied von der Erde_ with Park Ridge Civic Orchestra, debuted with Nashville Opera singing Pinkerton in _Madame Butterfly_ and returned to the Lithuanian National Opera for _Madame Butterfly_.

In the 2017-18 season, Diegel reprised his critically acclaimed role as Cavardossi in _Tosca_ with Palm Beach Opera and returns to The Metropolitan Opera in _Norma_ and _Madama Butterfly_. Additionally, Diegel performed two of his signature roles throughout the world as Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_ at Opera Hong Kong and Palm Beach Opera and Don José in _Carmen_ at San Francisco Opera, PORTopera, and Opera San Antonio. Additionally, Diegel sang the title role in Verdi’s _Don Carlo_ with Lithuanian National Opera, Ruggerio in _La Rondine_ with Opera Santa Barbara, Ismaele in _Nabucco_ with The Metropolitan Opera, and the tenor solo in Verdi’s _Requiem_ with Alabama Symphony Orchestra and Spokane Symphony.

Mr. Diegel made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Froh in Robert Lepage’s landmark production of _Das Rheingold_ conducted by Maestro James Levine, and later reprised the performance under Fabio Luisi. Further appearances at The Met include Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_ under Plácido Domingo and Ismaele in _Nabucco_ under Paolo Carignani. He will return to the famed house in 2019.

Other notable recent U.S. engagements include: Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_ at Atlanta Opera, Fort Worth Opera, Arizona Opera, Opera San Antonio, and Kentucky Opera; Ismaele in _Nabucco_ at Opera Philadelphia; Cavaradossi in _Tosca_ at Vancouver Opera, Glimmerglass Opera, Seattle Opera, and Arizona Opera; Don José in _Carmen_ at Glimmerglass Opera, Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Florida Grand Opera, Arizona Opera, and Madison Opera; and Rodolfo in _La bohème_ at Opera Omaha and Minnesota Opera.

Also in demand overseas, Diegel collects accolades from critics in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Of his performance in _Carmen_ at English National Opera, _The Guardian_ wrote: “The American Adam Diegel as José, tall and sturdy, looked the part of Carmen’s latest love victim and conveyed perfectly the pent-up anger of a feckless man who – we know from the original Merimée novel, but not the libretto – has already committed a murder…Diegel rose to the challenges of Acts III and IV.”

Other international appearances have included: Don José in _Carmen_ in a new production at Opera Australia’s Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour; Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_ with Lithuanian National Opera, The Savonlinna Opera Festival, and on tour in China at the Guangzhous Opera House in Anthony Minghella’s acclaimed production; Maurizio in _Adriana Lecouvreur_ at The National Theatre in Budapest, where he later performed Cavaradossi in _Tosca_; and David Alden’s new production of _Luisa Miller_ for Opéra National de Lyon.
