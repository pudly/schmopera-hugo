American mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Pojanowski is gaining renown in theaters and concert halls not only for her voice but for her electric stage presence and keen interpretation of new works. Opera News writes that in Chautauqua Opera’s production of *The Cunning Little Vixen*, “her Fox provided a charming love interest and a warm, clear timbre.”  In 2015, she sang Dorabella in Annapolis Opera’s production of *Cosìfan tutte* and also originated the role of Sadie in the critically acclaimed world premiere of Ricky Ian Gordon’s beautiful opera *Morning Star* with Cincinnati Opera.  She began 2016 performing Cherubino *Le nozze di Figaro* with Seattle Opera, and this summer will perform Isolier *Le comte Ory* with Loft Opera.

Pojanowski made her New York City Opera debut as Shelley in the American Premiere of *Anna Nicole* in 2013.  In 2014, she also made her Opera Omaha debut as Tisbe in *La Cenerentola*, which she then performed with NYCO Renaissance.  In 2008 she was proud to sing the role of Fiona in the workshop of Nico Muhly’s *Two Boys* with Bartlett Sher at the Metropolitan Opera.  A frequent visiting artist at Cincinnati Opera, she has sung Nancy T’ang in *Nixon in China*, Mercédès in *Carmen*, Tebaldo in *Don Carlo* and Ensemble in *Ainadamar*.

As a young artist at Seattle Opera, she performed Dinah *Trouble in Tahiti*, the Child (title role) *L'enfant et les sortilèges*, Hansel *Hansel and Gretel* and Hermia *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.
