NYC-based soprano Caitleen Kahn is an active performer of music of all eras, and is equally at home on both opera and recital stages. A passionate and communicative performer, she was most recently seen in Eastman Opera Theater’s *Albert Herring* (Mrs. Herring) and *Dialogues of the Carmelites* (Sister Gertrude and Madame Lidoine, cover). In 2014, she was selected as one of two vocalists to perform in the 25th Anniversary Concert for the Eastman Collaborative Piano Program. Ms. Kahn recently founded the organization Lynx Project  with colleague Megan Moore, as part of their mission to increase the performance of art song in the United States.

An avid proponent of arts advocacy, Ms. Kahn constantly seeks innovative ways to bring her music to new audiences.  To this end, Ms. Kahn runs and performs in an annual summer music event in her hometown of Milwaukee, WI called SoundWave Milwaukee where she brings together performers, composers, poets, dancers and visual artists in multi-disciplinary collaborations. She is also an active supporter of El Sistema USA, a group of community-based music education initiatives directed at underserved populations. Ms. Kahn spent 2014-2015 working in Volunteer Coordination and Outreach at ROCmusic Collaborative, Rochester’s El Sistema-inspired after-school music program for underrepresented urban children. She was recently awarded the Shouse Fellowship for 2015-2016, and will begin working this fall for Musicambia, another El Sistema initiative focused on teaching music in the prison system.

This May, Ms. Kahn finished her master’s degree in Vocal Performance at the Eastman School of Music, where she also received an Arts Leadership Program Certificate. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Vocal Performance from Indiana University, graduating with High Distinction and Departmental Honors. While at Indiana, Ms. Kahn spent a semester conducting original research on musical timbre and perception as part of her mission to find new ways to bring music to audiences. Notable teachers have included Kathryn Cowdrick, Timothy Noble, and Roberta Ricci.

When she is not singing, Ms. Kahn enjoys running, playing violin and piano, cooking, reading, and exploring new places.
