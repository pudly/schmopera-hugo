<p>
	Praised for his "sweetly rendered, fluid and pliable tenor voice", Christopher Mayell is quickly making his mark as a rising star in Canada's opera houses and concerts halls. <br>
	<br>
	From his acclaimed presentation of Britten's ALBERT HERRING in St. John's, Newfoundland, to his interpretation of Handel's SOLOMON in Victoria, British Columbia, Christopher maintains a hearty schedule of engagements across the country. Future performances include Verdi's FALSTAFF with Calgary Opera, Offenbach's LA VIE PARISIENNE with Toronto Operetta Theatre, and Haydn's LORD NELSON MASS with the Stratford Concert Choir. <br>
	<br>
	Recent appearances include a debut performance of Bach's renowned Cantata No. 55 'ICH ARMER MENSCH' with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Bach's CHRISTMAS ORATORIO with the Kingston Symphony, Mozart's GREAT MASS IN C MINOR and Orff's CARMINA BURANA with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, Mozart's REQUIEM with the Grammy-nominated Elora Festival Singers. He has also joined the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra as well as Orchestra London for performances of Handel's glorious MESSIAH. <br>
	<br>
	Christopher is enjoying a growing international presence, including a portrayal of the title role in a world-class production of ALBERT HERRING at the Aldeburgh Festival in England (alongside soprano Felicity Lott), as well as a nationwide tour of China. <br>
	<br>
	Christopher is also a champion of new Canadian works, including Opera NUOVA's commissioned opera for younger audiences, THE LIVES OF LESSER THINGS, which toured extensively in Alberta. He also continues to work closely with Toronto's Tapestry New Opera Works in their development of new works, including Richard Payne's GET STUFFED!, and Aaron Gervais' OKSANA G. This season, he gave a debut performance with Toronto's Continuum New Music, performing a world-premier performance of 'FREDERICK'S DOCTOR', a narrative for tenor and instrumental ensemble. <br>
	<br>
	Christopher is a proud alumnus of the Calgary Opera Emerging Artist Ensemble program, through which he performed roles in Verdi's RIGOLETTO, Moore's THE BALLAD OF BABY DOE (Canadian premier), and Richard Strauss' ARIADNE AUF NAXOS (featured on CBC Radio's Saturday Afternoon at the Opera). While in Calgary, he was also featured by the Spiritus Chamber Choir in a national CBC Radio broadcast performance of Respighi's LAUDATE PER LA NATIVITA DEL SIGNORE. <br>
	<br>
	Christopher's endeavours are made possible by support from the Ontario Arts Council's Chalmers Professional Development Grant program, as well as through a generous grant from the Canadian Aldeburgh Foundation.<br>
