During his studies in Montreal, Bruno participated in many ensembles (both professional and academic) and had the opportunity to work with a host of music professionals. In the summer of 2013, he was invited to Texas to sing the role of Raoul de Gardefeu in the Opera Without Borders production of La Vie Parisienne . During the 2013-14 year, he participated in McGill's Song Interpretation class under the guidance of distinguished professor Michael McMahon and performed the role of Papageno in Mozart's *Die Zauberflöte* at the Blooming Voce Summer Opera Workshop in Indiana. January 2015 marked his Opera McGill debut as Il Conte Almaviva in *Le Nozze di Figaro*.
