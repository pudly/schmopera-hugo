Canadian tenor Andrew Haji is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after voices on both the operatic and concert stages. Winner of the Grand Prix at the 50th International Vocal Competition in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and the Montreal International Music Competition’s Oratorio Prize, Haji recently performed Bach’s _Matthäus-Passion_ with Pinnock and the National Arts Centre Orchestra and _Messiah_ for the Toronto Symphony – Debus conducting.

An exciting season in 2020-2021 is in the plans and includes Alfredo in _La traviata_ for Calgary Opera, _Elijah_ for Symphony Nova Scotia, Rodolfo in _La bohème_ for Edmonton Opera and a recital for the Jeffery Concert Series of London, Ontario. These projects will be subject to health advisories caused by the global pandemic.

Haji’s 2019-20 season began with Alfredo in _La traviata_ for Vancouver Opera, followed by _Messiah_ for the Edmonton Symphony, Pollione in _Norma_ for Calgary Opera, Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_ with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony and Beethoven’s _Symphony No. 9_ for the Victoria Symphony. Appearances during the 2018-2019 season included Rodolfo in _La bohème_ and Cassio in _Otello_ for the Canadian Opera Company (COC), Bach’s _Mass in B minor_ for the Amadeus Choir and Alfredo in _Die Fledermaus_ for Saskatoon Opera.

In 2017-2018, the Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern winner was heard as Nemorino in _L’elisir d’amore_ in Toronto for the COC and for Vancouver Opera, Beethoven’s _Symphony No. 9_ for the Toronto Symphony, _Messiah_ for the Grand Philharmonic Choir of Kitchener-Waterloo and the opening night gala at the Elora Festival. Haji is an alumnus of the COC Ensemble Studio and has also been heard at the Four Seasons Centre as Alfredo in _La traviata_ and Tamino in _Die Zauberflöte_. During his time as a member of the Ensemble Studio, his leading roles included Almaviva in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ and Ferrando in _Così fan tutte_.

The Salzburg Festival featured Haji in its production of Donizetti’s _Lucrezia Borgia_, his festival debut. For the Wexford Festival he starred as Hélios in Félicien David’s _Herculanum_ and for Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, as Rodolfo in Puccini’s _La bohème_.

Selected recent and upcoming concert engagements include performances of Haydn’s _The Creation_, Verdi’s _Requiem_, Puccini’s _Messa di Gloria_, Orff’s _Carmina Burana_, Rossini’s _Petite messe solennelle_, and Mozart’s _Requiem_, _Great Mass in C minor_, and _Coronation Mass_.

Andrew Haji holds both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree from the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Music where he performed in productions of _Les mamelles de Tirésias_, _Don Giovanni_, _Candide_, _Il mondo della luna_ and _Rob Ford: The Opera_, among others. He was invited to participate in young artist programmes at the Salzburg Festival Young Singers Project, the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, the Music Academy of the West and Accademia Europea dell’Opera where he was influenced by some of the world’s finest musicians. A native-born Ontarian, he has received awards from the Marilyn Horne Song Competition in Santa Barbara and the COC’s annual Ensemble Studio Competition.
