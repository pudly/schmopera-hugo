"Adrianne Pieczonka is a revelation, with a lavishly creamy
voice capable of expressing all the emotions that Elektra
forbids herself." (Financial Times)

“…her vocal performance was masterful and touchingly

expressive. It was a unique experience." (Opernglas)
“The true vocal laurels of the evening went to soprano
Adrianne Pieczonka, whose Senta was as dramatically
committed as it was stunningly sung. (Opera News)

“If you needed one good reason to go see the Canadian
Opera Company’s production of A Masked Ball, it would
have to be Adrianne Pieczonka’s unmatchable rendition of
the showcase aria ‘Morro, ma prima in grazia.’ It requires
a true artist to make the moment deeply touching without
falling into the sentimental, while also doing justice to the
absolute whirlwind of emotions that Verdi has layered into
the music. Pieczonka is up to both challenges.” (Toronto
Star)
