Multidisciplinary artist, Meher Pavri enjoys performing in opera, musical theatre, theatre, film/television, and is most passionate about new works. Highlights include playing Maria in Leonard Bernstein's *West Side Story*, the Canadian premier of the award-winning Bollywood play *Arranged Marriage* by Chitra Banerjee Divakurani, a reoccurring soloist in Soulpepper Theatre's Cabaret series, and Tapesty Opera's workshop production of *Selfie*, the opera by Julie Tepperman and Chris Thornborrow.

In 2016, she was very proud to be a part of the Ensemble (twice) for Against the Grain Theatreâ€™s *Messiah*, which won a Dora award for Outstanding Performance.

When not in a show, you can catch her performing at various gigs such as the anthems for her favourite sports team, the Toronto Raptors for over 17,000 people, or in a tv show or film, most recently on the big screen with Adam Sandler in the movie *Pixels* directed by Chris Columbus. She also recently sang in a live art exhibit entitled *The Good Indian Bride* alongside other artists like poet, Rupi Kaur.

Meher is a huge advocate for early childhood music education. She has taught and continues to teach hundreds of toddlers and their families the basics of musicianship using play with the Amici School of Music in Toronto and the GTA.

She is trained in Bharat Natyam dance and a certified yoga instructor. She currently resides in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
