San Francisco native, Filipino-American Baritone Peter Rolfe Dauz's performance highlights include Don Alfonso (*Così fan tutte*), Leporello (*Don Giovanni*), Figaro (*Le nozze di Figaro*), Achilla (*Giulio Cesare*), and Claudio (*Agrippina*).  This season at the Bard College Conservatory, Peter Rolfe sang the role of the Sprecher in Mozart’s *Die Zauberflöte* (January 2016) and was a soloist in Handel’s *Messiah* (April 2016). Peter Rolfe was recently invited as one of fifteen young professionals to Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century to perform the role of Junius in Britten’s *The Rape of Lucretia* at The Banff Centre (Alberta, Canada).

In 2014, Peter Rolfe began his Master’s Degree at McGill University and performed the title role in *Le nozze di Figaro* as well as Betto in Puccini’s *Gianni Schicchi*.  Currently, Mr. Dauz is a first year graduate student of the Vocal Arts Program at Bard College where he is currently working with Sanford Sylvan, Dawn Upshaw, Kayo Iwama and Erika Switzer.  Peter Rolfe made his New York State symphonic debut as the Bass soloist in Handel’s *Alexander’s Feast* (November 2015) with the Broad Street Orchestra in Kinderhook, New York and collaborated with Dawn Upshaw in part-songs on the Haydn Project at Bard College.

Mr. Dauz received his Bachelor of Music degree in Vocal Performance at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 2011.  In the summer of 2013, he was a Young Artist in the Castleton Artist Training Festival in Castleton, Virginia founded by Maestro Lorin Maazel. At Castleton, Peter Rolfe covered the role of Bello in *Fanciulla del West*.  During the three years between him receiving his Bachelor’s degree and the beginning of his graduate studies, Mr. Dauz established a private vocal studio of over 30 students, taught Kindergarten though 8th grade music education and was a cantor at St. James Catholic Church in San Francisco. His time educating the youth was rewarding and enriching but it was the summer in Virginia and the yearning to fine tune his craft that propelled him to further his studies in music and the vocal arts.
