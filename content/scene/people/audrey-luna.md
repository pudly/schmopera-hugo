Audrey Luna stands out from the crowd with her unique combination of mesmerising stage presence and stratospheric vocal range. Now a frequent guest at New York’s Metropolitan Opera, Luna was unanimously praised for her 2012 debut there as Ariel in Thomas Adès’ *The Tempest* and stars on the Grammy award-winning DVD of the production, released by Deutsche Grammophon. 

In the summer of 2016, Audrey Luna debuted at the Salzburger Festspiele in the world premiere of Thomas Adès’ latest opera, *The Exterminating Angel*. Conducted by the composer himself, Audrey Luna created the high flying role of Leticia which she will repeat this season in London when the production goes to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

Elsewhere in the current season, Luna debuts with the London Symphony Orchestra and Berliner Philharmoniker under Sir Simon Rattle in Peter Sellar’s semi-staging of Ligeti’s *Le Grand Macabre*, singing both Venus and Gepopo. Audrey Luna also collaborates for the first time with Peter Eötvös performing his latest commission, *Sirens*, with the Calder Quartet at Tonhalle in Zürich, IRCAM Paris and at the Donaueschingen Festival, and closes the season with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra in Ligeti’s *Requiem*.
 
Highlights of Luna’s operatic portfolio include her 2015 Wiener Staatsoper debut in *The Tempest*, conducted by Adès; Fiakermilli (*Arabella*) and Olympia (*Les contes d’Hoffmann*) at The Met; Zerbinetta (*Ariadne auf Naxos*) at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and Tanglewood Festival; the title role in *Lucia di Lammermoor* with Opera Naples; Olympia at Den Norske Opera; and the creation of the role of The Accuser in the world premiere of Bright Sheng’s *Madame Mao* at Santa Fe Opera. As a resident artist at Pittsburgh Opera, Audrey sang a number of roles including Adina (*L’elisir d’amore*), Giulietta (*I Capuleti e i Montecchi*) and Erisbe (Cavalli’s *L’Ormindo*) and also counts Cunegonde (*Candide*), Gilda (*Rigoletto*) and Madame Mao (*Nixon in China*) among her wider repertoire.

Recent concert appearances include Orff’s *Carmina Burana* with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra and Andrew Litton, *Le Grand Macabre* with the New York Philharmonic and Alan Gilbert, Unsuk Chin’s *Cantatrix Sopranica* with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Benjamin Shwartz and Scenes from *The Tempest* with the San Francisco Symphony and Pablo Heras-Casado.
