Acadian baritone Dion Mazerolle received critical acclaim for his "fine, resonant voice, an iron fist in a velvet glove" as Lord Cecil in Britten's _Gloriana_ with Toronto's Voicebox: Opera in concert.

Recent opera credits include the Mandarin in Edmonton Opera’s production of _Turandot_, and a début with the Canadian Opera company in the role of F. X. Lemieux in their powerful 2017 production of _Louis Riel_, which was also performed at the National Arts Centre and the Opera de Quebec. He also stepped in at the last minute to star in Handel’s _Apollon et Daphne_, with Festival Montreal Baroque.

Dion begins the 2018/19 season as Johann in Opera de Quebec’s _Werther_, followed by Germont in _La Traviata_, with Société d’Art Lyrique du Royaume, Bach’s B Minor Mass with Montreal’s acclaimed Ensemble Caprice, and in _Kopernikus_ (Vivier) with Against the Grain Theatre, Toronto.

Operatic roles for Dion include the Mayor in Janacek’s _Jenufa_ directed by Atom Egoyan with Pacific Opera Victoria, Dick Deadeye in _HMS Pinafore_ with Edmonton Opera, and Dancaire in _Carmen_ with the Opera de Quebec. In 2018, Dion sang the role of Avadoro in _Manuscrit trouve a Saragosse_ (Evangelista), with Société de musique contemporaine du Québec.

Dion has appeared in concert with the Elmer Iseler Singers, (Bach’s _Christmas Oratorio_) and debuted with the Newfoundland Symphony in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. He sang the bass arias in a semi-staged performance of Bach’s _St. Matthew Passion_ with Chorus Niagara, Christus (_St. Matthew Passion_) with Musica Orbium, and the bass arias in Bach’s _St. John Passion_ with the Grand Philharmonic Choir/Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony Orchestra.
