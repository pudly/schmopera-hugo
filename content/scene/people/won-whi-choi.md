Won Whi Choi has been busy captivating and thrilling audiences worldwide with his lustrous and ringing voice, elegant musicianship, and sensitive artistry. He spent the last three seasons at Theatre Erfurt in Germany, in which he sang a variety of leading roles, including, Il Duca in _Rigoletto_, Don José in _Carmen_, Roméo in _Roméo et Juliette_, Ferrando in _Così fan tutte_, Tamino in _Die Zauberflöte_, Hyllus in _Hercules_, Andres in _Wozzeck_, Il Cantatore in _Giulietta e Romeo_, and Prince Sou Chong in Lehár’s _Das Land des Lächelns_. In his first New York City performance, Choi was praised for his portrayal of Rodolfo in _La bohème_ and his “big, virile sound that rocketed fearlessly up to a high C, so secure he dared to run across the stage while holding the note,” by The New York Observer.

This season, he performs Alfredo in _La Traviata_ with Williamsburg Opera and Nashville Opera, as Da-Ud in _Die agyptische Helena_, Hoffmann in _Les Contes d’Hoffmann_ with Opera Orlando, and Souchong in _Das Land des Lachelns_ in the 2019 Morbisch Festival. He also returns to The Metropolitan Opera for their production of _Don Giovanni_.  This past summer he performed Don Jose in _Carmen_ in over 10 performances of the Domstufen Festival.

Recent seasons’ engagements include a return to The Metropolitan Opera for _L’elisir d’amore_ and _Cosi fan tutte_, a role début as Arcadio in _Florencia en el Amazonas_ with New York City Opera; Rodolfo in _La bohème_ in débuts with Croatian National Theatre in Osijek; Prince Sou-Chong in Franz Lehar’s _Das Land des Lächelns_ in a début with Hong Kong Opera and with Theater Erfurt; Ruggero in _La rondine_ at Skylark Opera; Edgardo in _Lucia di Lammermoor_ with Opera in Williamsburg; Chevalier in _Dialogues des Carmélites_ with Mannes Opera Theatre;  Alfredo in _La traviata_ for Mannes Opera Theatre and Opera på Skäret in Sweden; the title role in _Les contes d’Hoffmann_ with the Martina Arroyo Foundation; and Il Duca in _Rigoletto_ at Opera Idaho, where critics raved: “Choi made for a strapping and sexy Duke of Mantua, which makes it more believable that women would so willingly fall for his charms, and sacrifice themselves for his life. His soaring tenor easily and fearlessly reached the high Bs in ‘La donna è mobile,’ one of the most known arias in the operatic canon.”

Mr. Choi is emerging as a concert artist to watch after his performance of Händel’s _Messiah_ with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. _The Winnipeg Free Press_ hailed: “Won Whi Choi asserted his booming presence immediately with his opening recitative ‘Comfort ye my people’ followed by aria ‘Ev’ry valley shall be exalted.’ Demonstrating a remarkable vocal strength…the singer responded ably to the composer’s many virtuosic runs while also displaying an equally impressive dynamic range.” Recently, he also sang in an opera gala at Shanghai Symphony Orchestra Hall in Shanghai, China, to great critical acclaim.

Mr. Choi’s interpretation of Rodolfo in _La bohème_ garners acclaim on every stage he graces. From his performance in Croatia, Glas Slavinije wrote: “Won Whi Choi as Rodolfo sang his famous aria, with joyful accents excited enthusiasm and nobility, with pure lilting melodies and striking vocal line, effortlessly climbing to a high C. Choi’s performance was absolutely perfect, showcasing his excellent legato phrasing. The range of voice was remarkable! His performance consisted of high notes that were strongly developed, dynamic contrasts, great diction, vocal coloring, combined with world class phrasing and dynamic shading.”

Mr. Choi was one of eight finalists at the Montreal International Musical Competition in 2012. He holds a Professional Studies Diploma and a Master of Music Degree from Mannes College of Music and a Bachelor of Music degree from the Korean National University of the Arts.
