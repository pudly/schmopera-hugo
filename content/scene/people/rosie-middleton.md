Mezzo-soprano Rosie Middleton specialises in new music. In 2019 Rosie was artist in residence at Snape Maltings and The Banff Centre, where she collaborated with composers Laura Bowler, Catherine Kontz, Esin Gunduz Mira Calix and Michael Betteridge on Voice(less) – a series of works for voice and electronics exploring voice-loss, voicelessness and things that stop speech or sound. Her work is supported by Arts Council England, Help Musicians, The Finzi Trust and The Marchus Trust. An experienced improviser and deviser, Rosie loves working collaboratively with composers on multi-disciplinary works.

Rosie’s 20th and 21st century core repertoire includes _Pierrot Lunaire_ (Southbank Centre – reviewed as ‘staggeringly good’ – New Statesman), Boulez _Le marteau sans maître_, Berio _Sequenza III_ and Saariaho _From the Grammar of Dreams_. Rosie is an experienced performer of contemporary opera, with works including _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_ at the Royal Opera House Linbury Theatre and _#echochamber_ (in collaboration with Icelandic Opera, Reykjavik/UK Tour). She is a member of experimental music group Personal Clutter and was a 2020 Britten Pears Young Artist (Composition, Alternative Performance and Performance Art).  

Highlights of 2020//21 include Laura Bowler’s Gold with Riot Ensemble, a Somerset House Residency with Catherine Kontz on 12 Hours – an endurance piece for voice and electronics, Ed Nesbitt’s Antigone with East London Music Group and winning the Michiko Hirayama scholarship for excellence in experimental vocal music. Rosie was recently cast in the Royal Opera House’s upcoming (cancelled due to Covid-19) production of _Matt Rodgers She Described it to Death_.

Future engagements include premieres of works by Esin Gunduz and Yfat Soul Zisso for nonclassical, a Mira Calix premiere at Mimosa Gallery, and Jamie Hamilton’s Versionland with Phaedra Ensemble. In Autumn 2021 Rosie will perform a recital of works by Giacinto Scelsi at the Fondazione Isabella Scelsi in Rome.
