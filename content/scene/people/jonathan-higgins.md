I am a composer from England who is currently based in Sheffield where I am completing an MA in Sonic Arts, supported by the Julian Payne Scholarship. For the past year I have been working for Furnace Park in Sheffield as part of their ‘Sheaf Prospects’ soundscaping and composition project. My music is often densely gestural and noise based with influences from beat and glitch based music.

I have presented works both in the UK and internationally, most recently at the ICMC (Athens 2014, Texas 2015), Metanast (Manchester), Sound Junction (Sheffield) and Noise Floor (Staffordshire). My electroacoustic remix of Gary Carpenter’s piece “Neiderau” played by the Tempest Flute Trio was shortlisted for the Nonclassical 10 Remix Contest. Fragments, a piece based on Humpty Dumpty received a runners up prize in the USSS Nursery Rhymes competition.
