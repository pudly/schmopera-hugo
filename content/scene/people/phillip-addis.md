“The burnished yet vibrant and agile voice touches all the chords of human emotion… through a path of awareness and responsibility,” says _Connessi all’Opera_ of Phillip Addis’ portrayal of Britten’s Billy Budd, one of the Canadian baritone’s enviable, signature roles. Mr. Addis, known for his “nimble and expressive” sound and “athletic command of the stage” (_Twin Cities Arts Reader_), is established as one of Canada’s leading performers of opera, concert, and recital repertoire. He is acclaimed internationally for his interpretation of Count Almaviva in _Le nozze di Figaro_, where he sings “an impeccable antagonist”, and is recognized as “the ideal Pelléas of his generation” for his “erotically charged” performances of Debussy’s _Pelléas et Mélisande_ in Hamburg, Paris, Luxembourg, Cincinnati, Dresden, as well as at the Ruhrtriennale and the BBC Proms. Mr. Addis has performed on the world’s major stages, including l’Opéra national de Paris, LA Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, Semperoper Dresden, and the Hamburgischen Staatsoper, under the distinguished batons of Sir John Eliot Gardiner, James Conlon, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Seiji Ozawa, Kent Nagano, Carlo Rizzi, and more.

Mr. Addis’s 2020/21 season began with Laura Kaminsky’s _As One_, where he sang Hannah Before in a livestreamed production with Orchestre classique de Montréal. In 2021 he will sing in a new production of _Pelléas et Mélisande_ by Renaud Doucet and André Barbe, originally set for 2020 but postponed due to COVID-19, with performances in Parma, Modena, and Piacenza. In the fall of 2021, Mr. Addis will sing Il Conte in two upcoming productions of _Le nozze di Figaro_, at Opéra de Lausanne and the Royal Opera of Versailles.

In recent seasons, Mr. Addis brought Il Conte to Edmonton Opera’s _Le nozze di Figaro_, and sang the Count in Against the Grain Theatre’s adaptation of Mozart’s staple, _Figaro’s Wedding_. He sang in back-to-back productions of _La Bohème_, as Schaunard with the Canadian Opera Company, and as Marcello with Vancouver Opera. In 2018 he made two last-minute step-ins, as Pelléas at Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg, and as Billy Budd at Teatro dell’Opera di Roma.

Additional operatic credits include the title role in the world premiere of _Pyramus and Thisbe_ with the Canadian Opera Company, _Eugene Onegin_ at Calgary Opera, Figaro in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ with Edmonton Opera, Papageno in _Die Zauberflöte_ with the COC, Jaufré Rudel in _L’amour de loin_ with the Festival d'Opéra de Québec and the Vlaamse Oper, Mercutio in _Roméo et Juliette_ with Minnesota Opera and Opera Carolina, Lt. Audebert in _Silent Night_ with Opéra de Montréal and Cincinnati Opera, Il Conte in _Le nozze di Figaro_ with the Semperoper Dresden, Vancouver Opera, Pacific Opera Victoria, Opéra de Montréal, and Florida Grand Opera, and as Frère Léon in _St. François d’Assise_ with Yomiuri Nippon Orchestra in Tokyo, which was selected as the best production of 2017 by the vote held by Ongaku-no-Tomo magazine.

Mr. Addis balances his operatic career with extensive concert experience, including the 2019 world premiere of Scott Good’s _The Sleepers_ with London Sinfonia. He was the baritone soloist for _Carmina Burana_ with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Orchestre Symphonique de Trois Rivières, Vaughan Williams’ _Dona Nobis Pacem_ with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, and Britten’s _War Requiem_ with the Cincinnati May Festival, the Britten LA/100 Festival, and the Nashville and Victoria Symphonies.

With a passion for the art song repertoire, Addis has given recitals with pianist, Emily Hamper at the l’Opéra National de Paris, The Brisbane Music Festival, the Orford Arts Centre, the Vancouver International Song Institute, and the Canadian Art Song Project; in 2020, they offered livestream recitals for the Brott Music Festival, Against the Grain Theatre, Stratford Summer Music, and the Stratford Symphony Orchestra. Together, Addis and Hamper are co-Artistic Directors of the Stratford Summer Music Vocal Academy, mentoring and inspiring developing artists with a passion for all facets of the classical vocal discipline.
