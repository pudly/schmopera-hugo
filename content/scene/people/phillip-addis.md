Phillip Addis has established himself as one of Canada's finest and most versatile baritones. His range makes him at once "a superb Billy Budd…(whose) voice was virile, free and open" as well as "an impeccable antagonist" as Mozart's Conte di Almaviva, while he is perhaps best known as "the ideal Pelléas of his generation" for his "erotically charged" performances as Debussy's leading lover. Mr. Addis has performed on the world's major stages, including l'Opéra National de Paris, LA Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, Semperoper Dresden, and the Hamburgischen Staatsoper, il Teatro Regio di Parma, il Teatro dell' Opera di Roma, and the BBC Proms,  lead by such distinguished conductors as Sir John Eliot Gardiner, James Conlon, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Seiji Ozawa, Kent Nagano, Carlo Rizzi, and Sylvain Cambreling.  

In the 2022-23 season, Mr. Addis returned to cherished roles: Zurga in Bizet's _Les pêcheurs de perles_ with Vancouver Opera, and Pelléas with Teatro Municipale di Piacenza and Teatro Comunale di Modena. He also made exciting role debuts as Don Alfonso in Pacific Opera Victoria's production of _Così fan tutte_ and as Sharpless in _Madama Butterfly_ with Opéra de Québec.

In 2021 Mr. Addis was featured as Il Conte in _Le nozze di Figaro_ at Opéra de Lausanne and the Opéra Royal de Versailles. He also starred in the Rai5 live broadcast of the new Barbe&Doucet production of _Pelléas et Mélisande_ from Teatro Regio di Parma.

Additional leading roles include Onegin at Calgary Opera, _Don Giovanni_ with Edmonton Opera where he also performed as Figaro in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_, as well as Papageno in _Die Zauberflöte_ and Marcello in _La Bohème_ with the Canadian Opera Company. Notable successes in the French repertoire include the title role in the baritone version of _Werther_ with l'Opéra de Montréal, as Jaufré in _L'amour de loin_ with the Festival d'Opéra de Québec and the Vlaamse Oper, as Zurga in _Les pêcheurs de perles_ with Vancouver Opera and l'Opéra de Montréal, and as Frère Léon in the award-winning _St. François d'Assise_ with the Yomiuri Nippon Orchestra.

Mr. Addis balances his operatic career with extensive concert experience.  He was the baritone soloist for _Carmina Burana_ with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Canada's National Arts Centre Orchestra, and Britten's _War Requiem_ with the Cincinnati May Festival, and the Britten LA/100 Festival. as well as the world premiere of Scott Good's _The Sleepers_ with London Sinfonia.
