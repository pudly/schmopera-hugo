Chad Kranak, Armenian-American tenor, praised for his "lyrical eloquence and attractive lyric sound" by _Opera News_, is known for the musicality and vulnerability he brings to the stage. His 2021-22 season is so far set to include Pinkerton in _Madama Butterfly_ with New Rochelle Opera, Luzio in Wagner's _Das Liebesverbot_ with the Cambridge Chamber Ensemble, a return to Virginia as the tenor soloist for the Saint-Saëns Requiem, and making his role debut as Cavaradossi in _Tosca_ with New Rochelle Opera this spring. 

His 2019-20 season included being the tenor soloist in Handel's _Messiah_ with the Sequoia Symphony, Rinuccio in _Gianni Schicchi_ with Regina Opera, and prior to cancellations due to the pandemic, he was scheduled to perform the title role in Rimsky-Korsokov's _Kashchey the Deathless_ with Bel Cantanti Opera, Don Jose in _Carmen_ with Stony Brook Opera, the tenor soloist in the Verdi _Requiem_ and Berlioz’s _Messe solennelle_, as well as a workshop of a new opera through Opera Parallèle.

In 2018, Chad returned to the Bard Music Festival as a soloist in the rarely performed Russian work Passion Week by Maximilian Sternberg. He then had the unique opportunity to perform with Madonna in her surprise Met Gala performance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  He also made his debut with New York Virtuoso Singers in Thea Musgrave’s Voices of our Ancestors and sang Handel’s _Messiah_ with both the Brooklyn Contemporary Chorus and Grace Church NYC, as well as Schubert’s _Nachtelle_ and Mass in G with the Riverdale Choral Society.

 2016-17 performances include Rhomboidal in _L’île de Tulipitan_ with Light Opera of New York, Doge in Rossini’s _Otello_ with Bard Music Festival, and Paulo in Rachmaninov's Francesca da Rimini with Garden State Opera.  He was also a dancer in Mark Morris' production of rarely performed _Curlew River_ by Britten at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 

During the 2014-15 season, Chad made his European debut, singing the Conte di Lerma in Verdi’s _Don Carlo_ with the Verbier Festival in Switzerland. He also appeared as Martin in Chelsea Opera's _The Tender Land_, in which _Opera News_ called his aria, “thebr highlight of the performance”, and as a guest artist with Stonybrook Opera, singing Normanno in _Lucia di Lammermoor_.

Originally from San Jose, California, Chad is now based in Brooklyn, New York where he spends his time building and riding bikes and refining his woodworking and leatherworking skills. Chad is an alum of UC Santa Cruz and CU Boulder.
