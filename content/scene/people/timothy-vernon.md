Timothy Vernon is considered one of Canada’s most prominent conductors, praised for his commitment to and vision of opera excellence in this country. As the founding Artistic Director of Pacific Opera Victoria, Maestro Vernon has led most of its more than 105 productions of 70 works - a repertoire that ranges from Handel to Berg and Britten, including Mozart, Verdi, Puccini and Wagner. He has led productions for Opera Lyra (*Die Zauberflöte* and *Faust*), l’Opéra de Montréal, Edmonton Opera, Calgary Opera, Opéra de Québec, among others. Also active on the concert stage, Maestro Vernon is a welcome guest conductor for some of Canada’s finest orchestras:  Vancouver Symphony, Edmonton Symphony, l’Orchestre symphonique de Montréal, Calgary Philharmonic, Toronto Symphony, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra for a Gala concert that was broadcast on CBC and filmed for worldwide distribution.

A dedicated pedagogue, Maestro Vernon served as artistic director of the Courtenay Youth Music Centre and was professor at McGill University where he conducted the McGill Symphony taking it to the National Arts Centre, Le Grand Théâtre de Québec, Montréal’s Place des Arts, Lincoln Center, and Carnegie Hall. A multi-year cycle of Gustav Mahler's works was particularly acclaimed, and the orchestra’s live Carnegie recording of Korngold’s Symphony in F-sharp (Polygram label) earned a JUNO nomination.

In February 2008, Vernon was presented with the Order of Canada in recognition of his work in expanding professional opera in Canada and his commitment to young musicians. Vernon is also a recipient of Opera Canada’s prestigious Ruby Award, Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and an honorary degree from Royal Roads University in recognition of his strong leadership in and contributions to Canada's cultural scene.
