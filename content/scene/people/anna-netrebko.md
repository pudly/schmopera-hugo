	Anna Netrebko has redefined what it means to be an opera star and in the process she has become one of the most acclaimed and widely-recognized classical singers in the world today. Regularly headlining productions at virtually every leading opera house across the globe, the Russian soprano has been hailed by the <em>Associated Press</em> as "the reigning new diva of the early 21st century." In 2007 she became the first classical musician to be selected as one of the <em>Time </em>100, <em>Time</em> magazine's list of the most influential people in the world. Her beautiful, dark, distinctive voice and her elegant and alluring stage presence have prompted critics to describe her as "Audrey Hepburn with a voice" and "a singer who simply has it all: a voice of astounding purity, precision, and scope, extensive dynamic and tonal range, imagination, insight, and wit—all combined with a dazzling charisma that makes it all but impossible to look away when she is performing" (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>).
</p>
<p>
	Since her triumphant Salzburg Festival debut in 2002 as Donna Anna in Mozart's<em>Don Giovanni</em>, Netrebko has gone on to appear with nearly all the world's great opera companies, including the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, London's Royal Opera House, Milan's Teatro alla Scala, Vienna State Opera, Paris Opera, Zurich Opera, Berlin State Opera, and Munich's Bavarian State Opera. She frequently returns to the Kirov Opera at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg (where she made her stage debut as Susanna in Mozart's <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>) to collaborate with her longtime mentor, conductor Valery Gergiev. As well as Mozart's Susanna, Netrebko's other signature roles past and present include Puccini's Mimì (<em>La bohème</em>) and Manon Lescaut; Verdi's Violetta (<em>La traviata</em>), Lady Macbeth (<em>Macbeth</em>) and Giovanna d'Arco; Bellini's Giulietta (<em>I Capuleti e i Montecchi</em>), Elvira (<em>I puritani</em>), and Amina (<em>La sonnambula</em>); Mozart's Donna Anna (<em>Don Giovanni</em>); Donizetti's Norina (<em>Don Pasquale</em>), Adina (<em>L'elisir d'amore</em>), Lucia (<em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>), and Anna Bolena; the title role in Massenet's <em>Manon</em>; Juliette in Gounod's<em> Roméo et Juliette</em>; and Tchaikovsky's Tatiana (<em>Eugene Onegin</em>) and Iolanta.

	Netrebko also appears extensively in concerts throughout the world, both in famous music venues such as New York's Carnegie Hall and in arenas in front of tens of thousands of people. Her outdoor concerts – in which she has shared the stage with artists such as Plácido Domingo and Dmitri Hvorostovsky at places ranging from Berlin's Waldbühne to Moscow's Red Square – are often internationally televised events. She is a fixture at the Salzburg Festival and has headlined the famous Last Night of the Proms in London. Netrebko frequently appears in recital with the world's leading artists, including Daniel Barenboim.
