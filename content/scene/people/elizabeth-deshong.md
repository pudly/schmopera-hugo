	When Elizabeth DeShong sang the title role of Rossini's La Cenerentola, at the <strong>Glyndebourne Festival</strong> The Guardian wrote: . . "this is, quite simply, one of the great operatic performances. It is dominated by DeShong, whose voice combines a contralto opulence with blazing top notes and some of the most staggering coloratura you will ever hear..."
