	When Elizabeth DeShong sang the title role of Rossini's La Cenerentola, at the <strong>Glyndebourne Festival</strong> The Guardian wrote: . . "this is, quite simply, one of the great operatic performances. It is dominated by DeShong, whose voice combines a contralto opulence with blazing top notes and some of the most staggering coloratura you will ever hear..."
</p>
<p>
	Next season, Ms. DeShong will perform multiple roles in the <strong>Metropolitan Opera's</strong> new production of Berg's <em>Lulu</em>, conducted by James Levine, followed by Fenena in <em>Nabucco</em> at <strong>Lyric Opera of Chicago</strong>, and Calbo in Rossini's <em>Maometto II</em> at the <strong>Canadian Opera Company</strong>.
