Recognized for her ability to communicate with an audience, soprano **Lauren Margison** is making her mark as a young artist of note. An alumna of the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, she was a member of the prestigious Atelier lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal, laureate of Jeune Ambassadrice Lyrique, and the youngest finalist to appear in the prestigious and highly competitive Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg Vocal Competition. A finalist and prizewinner in the 2017 George London Foundation Awards, Lauren went on to take first prize in the 2018 competition, and, this past season, garnered prizes in the Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition and was a semi-finalist in the Concours International Musical de Montréal.

Lauren’s upcoming and recent engagements include Micaëla in Bizet’s _Carmen_ with Pacific Opera Victoria, Tatyana in Highland Opera Studio’s production of Tchaikovsky’s _Eugene Onegin_, Beethoven’s _Symphony No. 9_ for Orchestre symphonique de Québec, _The Csardas Princess_ with Toronto Operetta Theatre, and the title role in Barber’s _Vanessa_ with Opera in Concert (Toronto). Lauren also looks forward to debuting two roles this season - Nedda in Leoncavallo’s _Pagliacci_ and Anna in Puccini’s _Le villi_.

Margison has been featured as Mïcaela in _Carmen_ with the Brott Music Festival, Fiordiligi in _Così fan tutte_ with Highlands Opera Studio, and appeared in concert with the PRISMA Festival in Strauss’s _Four Last Songs_. She also appeared as Mimi in a special presentation of _La Bohème_ with Artists of the COC Ensemble at The Four Seasons Centre and was featured in the COC’s _Elektra._

During her 2017-2018 season, Lauren returned to Atelier lyrique and appeared as Clorinda in _La Cenerentola_ with l'Opéra de Montréal and Missia in the Atelier lyrique’s production of _La Veuve joyeuse._ Lauren has also appeared as a soloist in Hommage à Reynaldo Hahn with the Société d’art vocal de Montréal, in the new opera _Mishaabooz’s Realm_ with the Highlands Opera Studio and Atelier lyrique de l’Opéra de Montréal, and in Beethoven’s _Missa Solemnis_ and Mozart’s _Requiem_ with Vox Luminosa and Choeur de Laval.

A versatile soprano, she has performed extensively both in Canada and internationally, specializing in classical, jazz and pop repertoire. Some highlights include performances for Opera Ontario, the TD Toronto Jazz Festival, The Beaches Jazz Festival, the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, the Cincinnati Pops, Hannaford Street Silver Band, the noon hour concerts at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts – Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, Ottawa Choral Festival Gala, and the Venetian Ball under the baton of Marco Armiliato, (fundraiser for Villa Charities, Toronto) held on the main stage of the Four Seasons’ Centre for the Performing Arts.
