Canadian countertenor Daniel Cabena is highly regarded in both Canada and Europe for prize-winning performances ranging from baroque to contemporary repertoire.

As Lydie-Anne in the world premiere of _Les Feluettes_ (March/Bouchard) with Opera de Montreal, critic Richard Turp declared his performance “both profoundly touching and utterly compelling, his vocal poise and theatrical aplomb constantly rewarding.” Daniel reprised his role with Pacific Opera Victoria and Edmonton Opera.

Daniel recently made his debut as a soloist in Bach’s Mass in G Minor at National Arts Centre with Bernard Labadie, Conductor. Further Canadian performances include Bernstein’s _Chichester Psalms_ with Grand Philharmonic Choir/Kitchener Waterloo Symphony, as well as _Messiah_ with Victoria Symphony and Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra.

Concert performances in the 2018/19 season for Daniel include “The Dark Side of Love” with Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, featuring arias by Rossini and Handel, Zachary Wadsworth’s The Temple with Spiritus Ensemble, “The Red Priest” (Vivaldi chamber cantatas) with Toronto’s Scaramella Ensemble, “Death by Chocolate” (works by Purcell) with Winnipeg’s Camerata Nova, Handel’s _Messiah_ with Vancouver Chamber Choir, and Bach’s _St. John Passion_ with Ottawa Choral Society.

European engagements for this exceptional artist include performances with Musica Fiorita, Ensemble Diapsalma, Le Concert Spirituel, and the Schlossmediale Festival. 

At the forefront of Canada’s contemporary music scene, Daniel recently starred as Ochre in Turning Point Ensemble’s premiere of _The Mute Canary_ (Komorous) at the 2018 New Opera festival in Ostrava, Czech Republic, followed by performances in Vancouver.

Daniel holds an Honours Bachelor of Music from Wilfrid Laurier University and a Doctorate of Music from l’Université de Montréal. He was the 2012 recipient of the Virginia Parker Prize by the Canada Council for the Arts and completed a Master in Specialized Early Music Performance at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland.
