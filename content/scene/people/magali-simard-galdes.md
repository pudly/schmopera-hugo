After a season marked by her debut as Soeur Constance (*Dialogues des Carmélites* – Opéra de Montréal), a Canadian tour of 30 recitals with the Jeunesses musicales du Canada (Maureen-Forrester Award), or her debut at the Festival de Lanaudière singing the first Flower-Maiden in *Parsifal* conducted by Maestro Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the young canadian soprano Magali Simard-Galdès' 2017/2018 season includes the roles of Roxane in DiChiera’s *Cyrano* and Gilda in Verdi's *Rigoletto* (Opera Carolina), Ève in Dubois’ *Paradis Perdu* (Atelier lyrique de Tourcoing) and the Mad Chorus in the world premiere of James Rolfe’s *The Overcoat* (Tapestry Opera and Vancouver Opera Festival). She also sings a recital of Canadian music with Olivier Godin at the Mexico Liederfest in Monterrey, a programm of Haendel's opera arias for the Festival de musique de Lachine (Québec) and a Charpentier/Vivaldi program with the Scherzi Musicali ensemble in Avignon.

Magali Simard-Galdès began studying music at the age of four when she started playing violin. Promised to a career in medicine, she decided to follow her passion and pursue a career in music.

After graduating from the Conservatoire de musique de Montréal, where she received her masters with unanimous high distinction, she joined the Opéra de Montréal’s young artist program for a two year residency and received a scholarship of excellence following her remarkable studies.

She has studied with renowned teachers such as Aline Kutan, Gabrielle Lavigne, Ethel Guéret, Lena Hellström-Färnlöf and perfected her craft with Diana Damrau. In masterclass she has worked alongside world class singers such as Natalie Dessay, Markus Werba, Russell Braun, Thomas Quafthoff and Camilla Nylund. In 2016, she was a fellow at the Ravinia Steans Music Insitute and spent last summer as a young artist at the Académie du Festival d’Aix-en-Provence.

Three time first-prize winner of the Canadian Music Competition and regional finalist of the Metropolitan Opera Council Auditions, she has also competed in European competitions such as the Hans Gabor Belvedere International Singing Competition in Amsterdam and the Wigmore Hall/Kohn Foundation International Song Competition in London.

In 2015, she made her international début in the role of Nicette (Le Pré aux Clercs) at the Wexford Festival Opera, in Ireland. The London Times wrote of her performance: "Yet the evening belongs to the [24]-year-old Magali Simard-Galdès (Nicette) making her professional debut with sparkling fioritura". She was also honored by the Wexford Festival Opera by receiving the Gerard Arnhold Bursary.

Magali has also performed the roles of Le Feu / Rossignol (*L'Enfant et les sortilèges*), Girl (*Trouble in Tahiti*), Miss Pinkerton (*The Old Maid and the Thief*), Lilette (*Trois jeunes filles nues*), Barbarina (*Le Nozze di Figaro*) and Venus (*Orphée aux enfers*).

Magali gratefully enjoys the valuable support of the Vancouver Opera Guild (2016 Career Development Grant), the Fondation Jeunesses Musicales Canada (2017 Choquette-Symcox Award) and the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation for Young Canadian Opera Singers.
