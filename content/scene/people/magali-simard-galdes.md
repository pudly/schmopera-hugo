Magali Simard-Galdès is a young Canadian soprano renowned for her shimmering tone, her refined musicality and her magnetic stage presence.

She made an acclaimed German debut in november 2020 at Oper Köln in the role of **Agnès** in Written on Skin (Benjamin). The production was streamed online due to covid-19 restrictions and a studio recording with the Gürzenich Orchester under François-Xavier Roth will be released in 2022.

In past seasons, she has sung with Montreal Opera in Written on Skin (Agnès), Opera Carolina in _Rigoletto_ (Gilda) and DiChiera's _Cyrano_ (Roxane), Canadian Stage and Vancouver Opera in the world premiere of _The Overcoat_ (Mad Chorus), Opéra de Montréal in _Dialogue des carmélites_ (Constance) and _Carmen_ (Frasquita), with Opéra de Québec in _Werther_ (Sophie), with Wexford Festival Opera in _Le pré aux clercs_ (Nicette) and with Opera Lafayette in _Bonsoir voisin_ (Louisette).

In recital, Magali has worked with many renowned pianists including Marie-Ève Scarfone, Olivier Godin and Bretton Brown. She has appeared at the Festival Classica, Société d'art vocal de Montréal, Festival d’Opéra de Québec, Mexico LiederFest in Monterrey (Mexico), Ravinia Steans Music Institute, Wexford Festival Opera, Concerts aux Îles du Bic and Jeunesses Musicales Canada (2015 Maureen-Forrester Award).

On the orchestral stage, she has performed with the Houston Symphony, the National Arts Center Orchestra, Orchestre symphonique de Québec, Arion Orchestre Baroque, L’Harmonie des saisons, I Musici de Montréal, l’Atelier lyrique de Tourcoing, l’Opéra Grand Avignon, le Festival Classica et le Festival de Lanaudière.

In the summer of 2019, with the Tionscadal na nAmhrán Ealaíne Gaeilge/Irish Language Art Song Project, she has recorded three new songs cycles by Deirdre Gribbin, Ailis Ni Riain and Fuhong Shi. On the ATMA Classique label, Magali can be heard in Berlioz's _25 romances for voice and guitar_ and Ana Sokolovic's _Sirens_. She also self-produced her first recital album “Muses”, which made Radio-Canada’s 2017 “50 albums of the year” list.

Magali has graduated from Atelier lyrique de l’Opéra de Montréal and Montreal Conservatory of Music. She has received First-prize at both the Récital-concours international de mélodie française du Festival Classica and Canadian Music Competition. She is very thankful to the Canadian Arts Council, Fondation Jeunesses Musicales Canada, Fondation Jacqueline Desmarais and Vancouver Opera Guild for their precious support.
