Canadian-german soprano Anna-Sophie Neher found a true passion in music at an early age. She studied piano at the Gatineau Music Conservatory for more than 10 years and distinguished herself in many competitions. Although she seemed destined to a pianistic career, at 19 years old she discovers the world of classical singing and decides to change vocation.

After receiving her Bachelor's degree from the Montreal Music Conservatory, Anna-Sophie spent a year in New York at Bard College to study with Dawn Upshaw and Sanford Sylvan. Back in Montreal to complete her Masters degree, she is now working with Dominique Labelle at McGill University. Throughout those years, she stood out in many competitions and was awarded numerous scholarships including the Jacqueline Desmarais Scholarship (2015 and 2016) as well as a Canada Council for the Arts scholarship (2016).

On the stage, she has sung the role of Adele in *Die Fledermaus* by J.Strauss with Opera MCGill (2017), Pamina in *Die Zauberflöte* of the Bard College production (2016), Belinda in Purcell’s *Dido and Aeneas* with the Montreal Conservatory of Music and Barbarina in *Le Nozze di Figaro* with the Orford international summer festival (2012).

In concert, Anna-Sophie was a soloist for multiple professional orchestras and choirs including the Gatineau Symphonic Orchestra and Festival International de Lanaudière's orchestra. We heard her soloing in *Carmina Burana* by Orff, in the Great Mass in C Minor, the *Coronation Mass* and the *Requiem* by Mozart, in *Der Rose Pilgerfahrt* by Schumann, in the *Gloria* and the *Magnificat* by Vivaldi and also in Bach cantatas at the Salle Bourgie.

This season, we will hear Anna-Sophie in recital with the Montreal Bach Festival, soloing with the Prisme Ensemble and also competing in the Montreal Symphonic Orchestra's Competition. In December she will have the chance to sing Handel's *Messiah* with the Gatineau Symphonic Orchestra.
