David Stout has rapidly established himself as one of the UK’s most versatile baritones. His repertoire ranges widely, encompassing early music with period instruments, Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, Britten, the bel canto repertoire and contemporary and twentieth-century works. He has earned a formidable reputation for his stage charisma, refined acting and presence on stage, as well as for being a great colleague whom other singers, conductors and directors are keen to work with again and again.

Recent highlights include a critically acclaimed Posa _Don Carlo_ (Grange Park Opera); Donner _Das Rheingold_ (with Sir Mark Elder and the Hallé); Marcello _La Bohème_ (Scottish Opera); Gratiano _The Merchant of Venice_ (Welsh National Opera); the title roles of _Le nozze di Figaro_ and Figaro Gets A Divorce (Welsh National Opera); Count Douglas in Mascagni’s _Guglielmo Ratcliff_ (Wexford Festival); the title role of _Le nozze di Figaro_ and Fritz Kothner _Die Meistersinger_ (both English National Opera); Sandoval _Le Duc d’Albe_, Paolo _Simon Boccanegra_ and the title role of _Falstaff_ (all with Sir Mark Elder and the Hallé); an acclaimed Sancho Pança _Don Quichotte_ (Grange Park Opera); Bach _St John Passion_ with the Aurora Orchestra at King’s Place; Oromazes in Rameau’s _Zaïs_ with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and Aeneas _Dido and Aeneas_ with the English Concert at the Bristol Old Vic.
