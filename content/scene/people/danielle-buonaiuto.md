Danielle Buonaiuto’s performances have been praised for their “terrific clarity and color” (Baltimore Sun), her “entrancing and fluid” singing (DC Metro Theatre Arts), and her “ethereal vocals” that reveal “exquisite vocal technique and luscious colors” (_OperaWire_).

After making her symphonic debut with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2011, she has appeared with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the orchestras of the Caramoor Festival, Peninsula Music Festival, and Lucerne Festival Academy.

Danielle maintains an active freelance schedule, presenting art song, performing chamber music, and appearing as soloist with symphonies and choirs throughout the United States and Canada. Though an accomplished performer of standard repertoire, she primarily focuses on working with contemporary composers, especially in commissioning new pieces and cultivating emerging composers. She has premiered over sixty songs, and has premiered roles in six operas. 

​Danielle has received grants from the Brooklyn Arts Council, New Music USA, and the Peabody Conservatory,  and has held fellowships at the Lucerne Festival, Bang on a Can at Mass MOCA, and Avaloch Farm Music Institute.

Danielle is driven by values of community, access, inclusion, and compassion. Reflecting her passion for storytelling through song, she has built a multifaceted career designed to maximize impact in intimate performances within her community. Her special interest in art song has led to recital programs at the Wright Theater in Baltimore and the Old Stone House in Brooklyn, among others, featuring the work of local composers and poets.

Canadian-born, she resides in Brooklyn. ​
