One of the most in demand artists today, British soprano Louise Alder has firmly established herself as "an instinctive singing-actress" (The Arts Desk) and "a terrific talent, combining a big, lustrous voice with flawless intonation and keen intelligence" (The Times). A hugely versatile artist she is equally at home in the world's most important opera, concert and recital venues such as Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Wiener Staatsoper, Glyndebourne Festival, Bayerische Staatsoper, Carnegie Hall and the Wigmore Hall, where she held a widely acclaimed artistic residency in 2024.

In the 2024-25 season, Alder will make several anticipated role debuts: her debut as Donna Anna in Mozart's _Don Giovanni_ at the Wiener Staatsoper; Micaëla _Carmen_ at San Francisco Opera and her first Contessa in a new production of _Le nozze di Figaro_ at Glyndebourne; as well as returning to the role of Susanna in the same opera, in the production she premiered at the Bayerische Staatsoper last season. On the concert platform her appearances include Strauss' _Vier Lieder_ Op. 27 with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra; a concert of Mozart Arias at the Royal Danish Theater; and Haydn's _The Creation_ with the Gulbenkian Orchestra. Handel also features heavily this season with engagements such as _Messiah_ with the Academy of the Ancient Music, _Alexander's Feast_ at the Mozartwoche in Salzburg; _L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato_ with Arcangelo; and a tour of _Giulio Cesare_ together with The English Concert at the Barbican and in North America, culminating with Carnegie Hall. In recital, Alder joins forces with tenor Mauro Peter and pianist Joseph Middleton for Wolf's _Italienisches Liederbuch_ which they will present at the Leeds Lieder, Wigmore Hall, Musikverein in Vienna and Oper Frankfurt.

Her engagements last season included Fiordiligi _Così fan tutte_ and Susanna in a new production of _Le nozze di Figaro_ at the Bayerische Staatsoper; and Cleopatra _Giulio Cesare_ for Glyndebourne Festival Opera. On the concert platform she sang Mozart concert arias with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment; arias by Mozart and Rossini with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra; the title role in Schumann's _Das Paradies und die Peri_ with the Royal Northern Sinfonia;  Canteloube's _Chants d'Auvergne_ with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks;  Mahler's Symphony no. 4 with the Bayerisches Staatsorchester and Vladimir Jurowski; Haydn's _Creation_ with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Edward Gardner; and Brahms' _Ein Deutsches Requiem_ with the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and Philippe Jordan. She also gave recitals in Schwarzenberg, Vienna, Helsinki, Stockholm and curated a season-long residency at London's Wigmore Hall.

Recent opera successes include Susanna for the Wiener Staatsoper, the Bayerische Staatsoper, and the Opernhaus Zürich; Zerlina _Don Giovanni_ for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and the Teatro Real in Madrid; Gretel _Hänsel und Gretel_ and Marzelline _Fidelio_ for the Bayerische Staatsoper; Sophie _Der Rosenkavalier_ for the Wiener Staatsoper and the Glyndebourne Festival; Anne Truelove _The Rake's Progress_ for the Glyndebourne Festival and Cleopatra _Giulio Cesare_ for the Theater an der Wien and Oper Frankfurt.

In concert, highlights include Mahler's Symphony No. 2 with the London Symphony Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle and his Symphony No. 4 with the Bayerisches Staatsorchester and Vladimir Jurowski; Janáček's _The Cunning Little Vixen_ with Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and Jakub Hrůša; Mozart's _Exsultate, jubilate_ with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Kirill Petrenko;  Strauss's _Four Last Songs_ with the Ulster Orchestra and Daniele Rustioni at the BBC Proms; the title role in _Theodora_ at the BBC Proms and at the Konzerthaus in Vienna with Arcangelo and Jonathan Cohen; the title role in _Semele_ on tour with the Monteverdi Choir and Sir John Eliot Gardiner; Schumann's _Szenen aus Goethes Faust_ with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; _Messiah_ with the New York Philharmonic and Harry Bicket; Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 with the Tokyo Philharmonic; and Mozart Arias at the Salzburg Mozartwoche with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra and Daniel Harding.

A hugely acclaimed recitalist her appearances include the BBC Proms, the Musikverein in Graz, Madrid’s Fundación Juan March and the Fundación Privada Victoria de los Ángeles in Barcelona, Snape Maltings, and the Oxford International Song Festival.

Her extensive discography includes Chère Nuit: French Songs, featuring songs from Ravel to Yvain (Chandos); The Russian Connection, programming songs by Rachmaninov, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Grieg, Medtner and Britten (Chandos); a disc of Strauss Lieder, _Through Life and Love_ (Orchid Classics) with pianist Joseph Middleton; Title role _Theodora_ (Arcangelo / Alpha Classics); Lucia _The Rape of Lucretia_ (Opus Arte / Glyndebourne); and the Title Role in Handel's _Semele_ (Monteverdi Choir / SDG).
