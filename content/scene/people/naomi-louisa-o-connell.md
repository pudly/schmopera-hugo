Naomi Louisa O’Connell made her professional debut in 2012, starring on London’s West End as Sharon Graham in Terrence McNally’s Tony Award-winning play _Master Class_. A singer, actress, and cabaret artist, her recent engagements include recitals at Carnegie Hall, Stanford University, and Rockefeller University; Bernstein’s _Jeremiah_Symphony with L’Orquestra Jovem do Estado de Sao Paulo; her one-woman German cabaret FRAU at New York’s Neue Galerie; a workshop of Richard Nelson’s new play _Oblivion_ with Lincoln Center Theater; and performances with Geneva Opera, Opera Omaha, and Spoleto Festival USA.

Last season, she appeared with the Cincinnati Symphony as Mélisande in the Maeterlinck play _Pelléas and Mélisande_ and will return for the same role in the opera of Debussy this October, conducted by Louis Langrée. Notable operatic roles include Monteverdi’s Poppea with Oper Frankfurt, Cherubino with Welsh National Opera and Opera Atlanta, and Offenbach’s La Périchole with Garsington Opera.

As an actress, she made her US stage debut as Rosine/Countess Almaviva in _The Figaro Plays_ of Beaumarchais at the McCarter Theatre and recently played the role of Lilli Vanessi/Kate in Cole Porter’s _Kiss Me, Kate_. Prizes include 1st Prize in both the Caruso/Altamura International Singing Competition and Concert Artists Guild Competition in 2011.

Hailed by The New York Times as “a natural in the recital format” for her Carnegie Hall debut recital entitled “Witches, Bitches, and Women in Britches” at Weill Recital Hall, she has performed in concert venues across the USA, and maintains an active recital career. A proud graduate of The Juilliard School and Royal Irish Academy of Music, Ms. O’Connell is currently based in New York City.
