Born in South Shields, Claire Rutter studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and at the National Opera Studio, sponsored by The Friends of English National Opera. She received outstanding reviews for her performance in English National Opera’s new production of *Lucrezia Borgia* ( “In the title role, Claire Rutter gives a glorious display of bel canto, with elegant legato, supple crescendo and diminuendo, crisply articulated runs, stunning high notes and even a trill. She looks wonderful and moves regally,” wrote The Daily Telegraph) and for ENO she has also sung Donna Anna (*Don Giovanni*), the title roles in *Tosca* and *Aïda*, Amelia (*Un ballo in maschera*), Elvira (*Ernani*), Gilda (*Rigoletto*) and Violetta (*La traviata*).

For three years, she was a company principal with Scottish Opera, where her roles included Maddalena (*Andrea Chenier*), Fiordiligi (*Cosi fan tutte*), Elettra (*Idomeneo*), Countess Almaviva (*Le nozze di Figaro*), the title role in (*Turandot*), Rosalinde (*Die Fledermaus*), Gilda (*Rigoletto*) and Violetta (*La traviata*). Elsewhere in the UK, she has sung Maddalena (*Andrea Chenier*) and the title roles in *Manon Lescaut* and *Giovanna d’Arco* for Chelsea Opera Group, the title roles in *La Gioconda* and Abigaille (*Nabucco*) for Opera North, Gilda (*Rigoletto*) and Violetta (*La traviata*) for Welsh National Opera and the title role in *Aïda* for Raymond Gubbay Ltd (“ Claire Rutter – already acclaimed in the title role at ENO – was on gleaming form, soaring to the climaxes of both of her big solos with apparently effortless ease…” wrote Opera). She has also established a close relationship with Grange Park Opera, where she has sung Elvira (*I Puritani*), the title roles in new productions of *Norma* and *Tosca* (“…the only British soprano with all the requisite vocal thrills and spills for Tosca, and she delivers big time…” wrote The Sunday Times) and Violetta *La traviata*.

She made her US debut as Fiordiligi (*Cosi fan tutte*) for Dallas Opera, being nominated for the Maria Callas Award, and recently returned as Donna Anna (*Don Giovanni*). Her international engagements have further included Donna Anna (*Don Giovanni*) for Opéra national de Bordeaux, Opéra national de Montpellier, Opéra national du Rhin, Strasbourg, and Opera Flanders; Donna Anna (*Don Giovanni*), the title role in *Aïda* and Amelia (*Un ballo in maschera*) for Finnish National Opera; Countess Almaviva (*Le nozze di Figaro*) and Tosca for Opéra de Bordeaux; Tosca for Pacific Symphony and Theater Basel; Mimi (*La bohème*) at the Beijing International Festival; the title role in *Aïda* for Opera Australia; Amelia (*Un ballo in maschera*) for Florida Grand Opera; Alice Ford (*Falstaff*) for Santa Fe Opera; Violetta (*La traviata*) for Den Norske Opera; and Sieglinde (*Die Walküre*) at the Opéra de Rennes.
