Grace Davidson is a British soprano who specialises first and foremost in the performance and recording of Baroque music.

Grace won the Early Music Prize while studying singing at London’s Royal Academy of Music. Since then, she has worked with leading Baroque ensembles of our day, singing under the batons of Sir John Eliot Gardner. Paul McCreesh, Philippe Herrweghe and Harry Christophers. Her discography includes a decade of CDs with The Sixteen, many of which feature her as soloist – Handel’s _Jeptha_ (as Angel), _Dixit Dominus_, Monteverdi’s Vespers of 1610, _Pianto della Madonna_, and the Lutheran Masses of Bach.

Next year she will record _Acis and Galatea_ for Harry Christophers with a performance at Wigmore Hall.

The technical mastery that comes with singing Baroque music plus Grace’s musicality and exceptional purity of tone have broadened her career into the worlds of contemporary classical and crossover music. With Max Richter she has recorded _Sleep_ and _Woolfworks_ (for Deutsche Gramophon). She has already performed _Sleep_ all over the world; next year, performances are planned in New Zealand, the USA, Germany and Australia. Next year she will record _Memoryhouse_, also by Richter.

She has made recordings (on Decca) with the American composer Eric Whitacre, with Christian Forshaw’s Sanctuary Ensemble and with Patrick Hawes on his celebrated album _Angel_. She is the solo singer on Howard Shore’s live-to-projection concert version of _Lord of the Rings_.
