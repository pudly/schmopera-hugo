Praised for her "glistening torrents of sound" (*Opera News*), American lyric soprano Claire Kuttler is a versatile singing actress, whose characters come to life with psychological depth and intensity onstage.  Currently, Ms. Kuttler is a returning apprentice artist at Bel Canto at Caramoor, after appearing last summer in Caramoor’s recital series and in *Dialogues des Carmélites*, under the direction of Will Crutchfield. Previously this season, Ms. Kuttler won an encouragement award from the Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation and was a semi-finalist in the Opera Birmingham Vocal Competition. She also made her debut with the Light Opera of New York as Rosie in Jerome Kern’s *Sally* and will be featured on the cast recording released later this year through Albany Records. 

Ms. Kuttler has performed across the United States with Palm Beach Opera, Central City Opera, Fargo Moorhead Opera, the Green Mountain Opera Festival, the Crested Butte Music Festival, Opera LaFayette, the Santa Barbara Chamber Orchestra and the New Jersey Festival Orchestra.
