In repertoire encompassing George Frideric Handel’s *Giulio Cesare in Egitto* to Jonathan Dove’s *Flight* and beyond, countertenor John Holiday’s expressive and richly beautiful voice has made him an increasingly sought after artist, possessing a “vocal instrument that threatens to equal the name artists in his range.” (Herald Times) Mr. Holiday is the recipient of the Marian Anderson Award from The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and Washington National Opera.

As an advocate of new works, John Holiday will make his debut with Opera Philadelphia singing the role of John Blue in a world-premiere of Daniel Roumain's *We Shall Not Be Moved*, a production directed by the award-winning Bill T. Jones that will also be seen at the Apollo Theater in New York and Hackney Empire in London. Also in the 2017-2018 season, Mr. Holiday will debut at Florida Grand Opera as Orfeo in Gluck’s *Orfeo ed Euridice* and his debut in Flight as the Refugee at Des Moines Metro Opera. He will make his Kennedy Center recital debut at the Terrace Theater and perform Handel’s *Messiah* with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. With the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel, he will sing Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms in Los Angeles and on tour in New York City at Geffen Hall, in Paris at the Philharmonie, and in London at the Barbican Centre.

Recently, John Holiday premiered Huang Ruo’s *Paradise Interrupted* at the Spoleto Festival USA, Lincoln Center Music Festival and Singapore Arts Festival.

He debuted at the Glimmerglass Festival in Vivaldi’s *Catone in Utica*. In concert, he also sang Messiah with Mercury Baroque and the Nashville Symphony.
