Praised for "a genuine and deeply satisfying sound" (*The WholeNote*), Canadian mezzo-soprano Lyndsay Promane was awarded second place in the 2016 Toronto Mozart Vocal Competition and was selected as a finalist in the Atelier Lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal National Auditions. She is also the 2015/2016 recipient of the University of Toronto Faculty of Music Opera Division Scholarship. 

In the 2018/2019 season, Lyndsay looks forward to portraying Zulma (*L’Italiana in Algeri*) with Vera Causa Opera. Recent roles include Larina (*Eugene Onegin*), Poppet (*Paul Bunyan*), the title role of *The Medium*, The Lady with the Hat Box and the Foreign Singer (*Postcard from Morocco*). Other highlights include Endimione (*La Calisto*), Little Buttercup (*HMS Pinafore*), Hansel (*Hansel und Gretel*) and Bradamante (*Alcina*). Lyndsay has had the pleasure of creating roles including Lucy Bridgeland and Edwina (*Footsteps in Campbell House*), The Woman in his Life (*Encounters*) with UofT Opera, and Julia/Jules (*Pomegranate*) with Tapestry Opera.

A frequent interpreter of sacred music, Lyndsay has performed solo roles with the Toronto Korean-Canadian Choir, the London Pro Musica Choir, the Oakville Choral Society, Chorus Niagara, the University of Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, and the Vianden International Music Festival to name a few. She recently appeared as the alto soloist in Mozart's *Requiem* with the Toronto Mozart Players and the Hart House Chorus under the direction of Dr. David Bowser.  Lyndsay is delighted to be making her recital debut in June 2018 at the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto. As well as being engaged by vibrant opera companies such as MYOpera and Tapestry Opera, Lyndsay is an alumna of several summer programs including Summer Opera Lyric Theatre, the Vianden International Music Festival, the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, and St. Andrew-by-the-Sea's opera workshop.
