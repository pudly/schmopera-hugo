### MISSION

AOP’s mission is to develop and present new and innovative works of lyric theater, provide a creative home to emerging and established artists, and engage contemporary communities in a transformative operatic experience.

### BIO

In 2019, American Opera Projects became The American Opera Project. But we are still AOP. As AOP, we continue a proud legacy of being at the forefront of the contemporary opera movement for over thirty years through the commissioning, developing, and producing of opera and music-theatre projects, training programs for student and emerging composers and librettists, and community engagement.

AOP has produced over 30 world premieres, including the Nathan Davis/Brendan Pelsue dance chamber opera _Hagoromo_ starring Wendy Whelan (BAM, 2015), Kaminsky/Reed/Campbell's _As One_ (BAM, 2014), Nkeiru Okoye's _Harriet Tubman: When I Crossed That Line to Freedom_ (Irondale Center, 2014), and Lera Auerbach's _The Blind_ (co-production with Lincoln Center Festival, 2013) and the 2017 co-production with Nashville Opera of Robert Paterson and David Cote’s _Three Way_ (Nashville Opera, BAM Fisher).

Other notable premieres include Kimper/Persons' _Patience & Sarah_ (1998), Weisman/Rabinowitz's _Darkling_ (2006), Lee Hoiby's _This is the Rill Speaking_ (2008), and Phil Kline's _Out Cold_ (2012) at BAM.
