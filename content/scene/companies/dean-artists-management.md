<p>
	Dean Artists Management brings over twenty years of excellence and expertise to the management of classically trained singers, conductors, opera directors and choreographers.
</p>
<p>
	Committed to integrity and personal attention, the size and structure of our agency enables us to remain responsive to our clients' needs, while sustaining successful relationships with producers in North America and abroad.
</p>
<p>
	Working as a team to strategically broaden the careers of established artists, we are equally known for our ability to nurture and guide emerging careers. Our artists include specialists in both early and contemporary music, carefully chosen "cross-over" artists, and those directors and conductors who have a particular<br>
	knowledge of, and affinity for, opera, choral and vocal orchestral repertoire.
</p>
<p>
	After twenty years in international arts management, we remain competitive and attuned to the trends of opera and classical music markets, and to the visions of our colleagues and clients.
