LYNX, also known as Lynx Project, is a Chicago-based nonprofit organization that amplifies diverse voices through new song commissions, inclusive concerts, and educational programming. Founded in 2015 by Caitleen Kahn, Megan Moore, Steven Humes, and Florence Mak, LYNX was formed to revitalize the genre of art song and share it with new audiences.

LYNX is passionate about bringing modern voices and new perspectives into the art song canon, and has commissioned over four hours of new music through its Amplify Series. Championing emerging and established performers and composers, LYNX offers meaningful artistic opportunities and fosters deep connections between artists and communities. LYNX is now headed by Executive Director Caitleen Kahn and Artistic Director Christina Giuca.
