#### History

The Boston Modern Orchestra Project is widely recognized as the leading orchestra in the United States dedicated exclusively to performing new music, and its signature record label, BMOP/sound, is the nation’s foremost label launched by an orchestra and solely devoted to new music recordings.

#### Board

Members of the Board of Trustees, Advisory Board, and the Score Board have a unique energy and a fresh, individual outlook on the arts. Comprised of executives, academicians, and entrepreneurs with relevant financial, educational, managerial, and artistic expertise, they are a diverse group of professionals representing several Boston-based companies, law firms, and non-profit organizations.

#### Staff

The BMOP staff realizes the orchestra’s mission by developing programs, creating partnerships with individuals and organizations that share our interests, advocating for new audiences, and working outside the box to insure BMOP’s fiscal health and vitality.
