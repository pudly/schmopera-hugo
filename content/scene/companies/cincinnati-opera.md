Founded in 1920 and the second oldest opera company in the U.S., Cincinnati Opera presents a thrilling roster of world-class artists and conductors, important company debuts, stunning sets and costumes, and the spectacular Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Today the company is hailed as Cincinnati's "prime summer arts festival," attracting a passionate regional audience as well as opera tourists from throughout the U.S. and Canada.

The 2017 season marks the 97th Summer Festival and the final of two seasons in our temporary, primary performance home–the Aronoff Center for the Arts–while our beloved Music Hall is restored and enhanced. The Harry T. Wilks Artistic Director Evans Mirageas will begin his eleventh season with the company. Considered one of the most talented and respected artistic leaders in the classical music industry today, Mirageas brings to Cincinnati Opera a broad range of experience in both opera and symphonic music, as well as a long history of successful partnerships with many of the world’s leading singers and conductors. In August 2006, Opera News named Mirageas one of the "25 Most Powerful Names in U.S. Opera."
