<p>
	Oshawa Opera's goal is to feature singers, pianists and musicians from across Ontario and to present concert adaptations operas to Durham Region. Oshawa Opera was founded on April 21, 2013 by Kristine Dandavino, a mezzo-soprano and pianist who resides in Oshawa.
</p>
<p>
	Oshawa Opera's first season included <em>Carmen</em>, <em>Das Lied von der Erde</em> and <em>An Afternoon at the Opera</em>: a gala concert featuring local artists. The Oshawa Opera chorus was formed for our <em>Carmen</em> production, and continues to grow with the company.
