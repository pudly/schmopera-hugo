<p>
	<strong>COSI</strong> provides a unique and extraordinary international opera performance and production training program for emerging artists. Within a short span of time, COSI not only established itself as Canada's leading and most comprehensive opera education and performance program in Europe, it is now embracing ever-expanding roster of international participants. Dedicated to providing the best with the focussed and refined training they require, COSI affords young singers, collaborative pianists, stage directors, stage managers and conductors the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the language and the culture that produced Italian opera, an appreciation that is vital to their artistic development. An intensive summer program, COSI fills a distinct gap by fostering young opera talent in an international setting. Participants not only add roles and repertoire to their experience, establishing a crucial boost to their abilities and audition prospects, they also gain insights into the dynamics of staging a professional-level opera and forge vital career-enhancing relationships with faculty and peers.
</p>
<p>
	Since 2007 COSI has embraced the training of almost four hundred singers, pianists, conductors, stage directors and stage managers. Twenty-two of these have been a part of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio during or after their COSI training, and fifty-five have taken their places in Canada's young artist opera programs in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal, as well as the Munich Opera training program, the Juilliard Opera Centre, and Lindeman Program of the Metropolitan Opera
