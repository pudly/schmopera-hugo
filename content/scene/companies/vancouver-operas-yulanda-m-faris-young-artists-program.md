In 2012, VO launched the Yulanda M. Faris Young Artists Program. Made possible through a gift from the family of Yulanda M. Faris, the program engages, enriches, mentors and trains rising young Canadian opera artists and offers a bridge between formal academic educational programs and the professional world in a supportive and encouraging environment.

The Young Artists Program provides up to seven artists - singers, pianists and stage directors - with the opportunity to train with industry leaders through master classes, one-on-one coachings and performance opportunities as part of a residency program.

The Young Artists Program includes VO's annual Young Artist Coaching Intensive, a program of coaching and instruction by industry-leading professionals was created in 2003. Made possible by the Judith Forst Fund for Young Artist Training, a dedicated fund within the Vancouver Opera Foundation, this program provides technical training at a crucial time when most young artists have left training programs or formal tutelage and are thrust into a heavy schedule of travel, performance and the study of new roles.
