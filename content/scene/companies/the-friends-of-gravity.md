Friends of Gravity: Big themes on a small scale!

We are making musical theatre that is intimately scaled, bold and contemporary in expression. Straddling several musical and theatrical genres, our performances lurk at the intersection of spoken word, cabaret, ritual, and opera.

Key to our expression are expressive immediacy; integration of multiple media including live action, live music, projected film and photographic images.
