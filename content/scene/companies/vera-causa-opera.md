Vera Causa Opera is an innovative opera company in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. VCO attempts to reinstate opera as an accessible and communicative medium through the adaptation of old operas and the composition of new ones! This initiative is carried out through education in schools, camps, and integrating local performers and professionals into VCO productions, in doing so creating a new and inviting operatic environment.

Out with the old, and in with the new! Vera Causa Opera is giving opera a new and exciting face lift. We feature some of the most brilliant young artists and professionals in the country. We firmly believe in providing performance opportunities for all, especially to those who have been unfairly overlooked. These opportunities are not just limited to singers! In fact, singers only makeup about 1/5th of our troop. Opportunities are available to aspiring Stage Directors, Set Designers, Costumers, Makeup Artists, Conductors, Instrumentalists, Actors, and even Visual Artists! Being part of VCO is a team sport. Everyone who takes part in our productions takes part in a community, a community which creates a positive, risk-free exploratory, collaborative, and welcoming environment.
 
I want to take part but... I'm not trained in opera. Pssst, don't worry about it! There's an opportunity for everyone in our productions. It may not be one of the intensely operatic roles - there's a reason people train for them - but that doesn't mean there's no place for you here! We are frequently extending into the surrounding community to educate and offer performance opportunities to all.
 
Opera is for everyone. We work hard to make that a reality. Whether it’s adapting old operas to be more accessible or presenting brand new ones, we go to great lengths to ensure that what we present is fresh and exciting. This means away with the massive halls, and in with: small theatrical settings, public settings, corporate events, weddings, universities, colleges, and schools of all levels. When it comes to affordability, you can’t beat us: $10 tickets for adults, $5 for members, and free for students.
 
So what are you waiting for? [Come enjoy a fresh new opera scene today!](http://www.vcopera.ca/this-season)
 
Oh, and wear jeans if you want to wear jeans. Dress codes are very 1800’s.
