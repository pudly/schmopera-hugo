SongFest: the United States' premier art song festival and training programs. The summer festival is held each May/June at the Colburn School in Los Angeles. SongFest attracts an internationally distinguished roster of artist teachers as well as students from some of the nation’s top music conservatories. Audiences enjoy a vibrant concert series presented in Colburn's state-of-the-art venues and auditors can attend daily masterclasses and lectures led by the most exciting artists of today.

In partnership with the Sorel Organization, SongFest has made a substantial contribution to the art song repertoire through its commissioning program that has produced new works for voice and piano by such distinguished composers as William Bolcom, Tom Cipullo, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Jennifer Higdon, Libby Larsen, Shulamit Ran.

A limited number of partial need and merit based scholarship opportunities are available.  SongFest Alumni feature prominently on the rosters of many opera companies, Young Artist programs, and University faculties.
