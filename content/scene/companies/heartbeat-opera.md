## Mission 

Heartbeat Opera creates incisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now. Our new, interdisciplinary collaborations expand the boundaries of what opera can be. Grounded in the belief that excellent opera-making should build community and radiate beauty, we work toward an equitable and inclusive future for our art form, centered in love.
