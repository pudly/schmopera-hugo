## ABOUT CENTRAL CITY OPERA

Less than an hour from Denver, Colorado in a lush Rocky Mountain setting, Central City Opera is among Colorado’s elite summer music festivals. The second oldest annual professional opera festival in the country (and the fifth-oldest opera company), the company continues to make history with a range of productions each summer including opera favorites, new and rarely performed pieces, and American works.

In addition to the summer Festival, Central City Opera’s Bonfils-Stanton Artists Training Program offers career-entry opera training to today’s young artists with career management classes as well as main stage rehearsal and performance opportunities. Year-round opera education and community engagement programs entertain and educate more than 100,000 people each year across the Rocky Mountain region. A steward of historic preservation, the company also maintains the Central City Opera House and 30 other Victorian-era properties which serve as performance and rehearsal venues and house Festival staff each summer.
