<p>
	The Atelier lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal was founded in 1984 with the goal of ensuring successive new generations of Canadian opera artists by offering a high-calibre training program combined with professional activities that serve as a practical introduction to opera-related careers. The program is open to some ten singers, vocal coaches and, on occasion, stage directors. Artists are selected in pan-Canadian auditions held each year in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.
