<p>
	Scottish Opera is Scotland's national opera company and the largest performing arts organisation in Scotland. The Company was founded by Alexander Gibson in 1962 and was inaugurated with a production of <em>Madama Butterfly</em> at the King's Theatre in Glasgow. In 1974 Scottish Opera purchased the Theatre Royal Glasgow, which reopened in 1975 as Scotland's first national opera house. The Orchestra of Scottish Opera was founded in 1980.
</p>
<p>
	We are committed to bringing the widest possible range of opera, performed to the highest possible standards, to the maximum audience throughout Scotland and the UK. Each year we perform in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness and over 30 other theatres, village halls and community centres across the country.
