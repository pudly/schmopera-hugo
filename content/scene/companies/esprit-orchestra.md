Esprit Orchestra is Canada's only full-sized orchestra devoted exclusively to performing and promoting new orchestral music.

Formed in 1983 by Music Director and Conductor [Alex Pauk](http://www.espritorchestra.com/aboutus/alexpauk.html), this innovative Toronto-based orchestra commissions, performs and promotes Canadian composers through its annual concert Subscription Series.

Every season, Alex Pauk and his 75-member orchestra collaborate with outstanding soloists and ensembles to give audiences spine-tingling performances of contemporary classical music in the acoustically acclaimed Koerner Hall at the Royal Conservatory of Music Telus Centre for Performance and Learning.
