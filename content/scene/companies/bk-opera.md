BK Opera was created to focus on stagecraft, to help emerging singers create real characters with depth. 

We focus on the "bare bones" of the opera, stripping away the usual pomp and circumstance to find the raw emotion at the heart of these pieces.
 
No sets. No props. No microphones. Just beautiful music and amazing singers.
