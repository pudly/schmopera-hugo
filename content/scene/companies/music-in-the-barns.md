Founded in 2008 by Artistic Director Carol Gimbel, Music in the Barns is rewriting the rule book for classical music in the 21st century. Specializing in multi-media, site-specific "installation concerts," Music in the Barns transforms spaces into uniquely immersive, live concert experiences. The company has produced critically acclaimed performances in some of Toronto’s most iconic locations, including the landmark building Artscape Wychwood Barns (with a 7,500 sq. ft. Mainspace), legendary The Drake Hotel’s “Underground," and The Academy of Lions. Most recently, their #1000Strings project garnered international attention, bringing together over 1000 performers and onlookers of all ages in Yonge-Dundas Square. The company's most recent project, Song of Extinction, a film and live score concert premiered in June 22, 2016 at the massive 400,000 sq. ft. Hearn Generating Station as part of Luminato's tenth anniversary season.
