<p>
	In an effort to revive the existing art song repertoire and to develop new vocal works for Canadian professional artists, tenor Lawrence Wiliford joined with pianist Steven Philcox and together founded the Canadian Art Song Project (CASP) in 2011. CASP promotes art song written by Canadian composers for Canadian musicians. More than simply encouraging artists and presenters to include some "Canadian content" once in a while, its mission is to encourage us all to embrace Canadian art song as a vital art form that speaks to performers and audiences today.
