Since arriving in Canada in the late 1970s, Spencer Duncanson has provided invaluable local leadership through numerous community contributions. Having served previously as chair of the Winnipeg Arts Council, Duncanson currently volunteers on the board of directors of the Winnipeg Foundation. 

A member of ACTRA, Duncanson holds a Masters of Education in Curriculum/Arts Education and a Post Baccalaureate Certificate in School Counseling from the University of Manitoba. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and Music Education from Brooklyn College in New York and is a studied vocal performance at the University of Nevada-Reno.

He is the founder of The Little Opera Company, a not-for-profit organization, dedicated to the production of operatic entertainment of high quality and broad accessibility. The organization also serves as a venue for local artists to profile and promote their talents.

As an arts educator and performer, as well as a talented operatic singer, Duncanson has experience in film and stage as a narrator and actor. He coordinated fine art, band, choral music, dance and drama programs for Sisler High School as its Visual and Performing Arts Department Head.
