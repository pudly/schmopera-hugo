Founded in 1998 with the ambition to stage world-class productions that inspire, challenge and entertain, Grange Park Opera has quickly become a beloved part of the European operatic landscape.

The season runs for seven weeks each summer, with four productions. Known as a small jewel with big performances, Grange Park Opera has staged some 53 productions to date. Many of these have been acclaimed for superb singing, outstanding conducting, and magnificent stage sets.

At the heart of the festival is a commitment to presenting both international and rising talent, introducing British audiences to little heard operas and bringing in a new audience to hear opera for the first time. To help develop the next generation’s love of opera, there are special schemes that offer [free tickets to young people](http://www.grangeparkopera.co.uk/under-30/musical-chairs/) and [subsidised tickets to under 30s](http://www.grangeparkopera.co.uk/under-30/meteor-tickets/).

In 2017, Grange Park Opera begins a new chapter as it moves to West Horsley Place, Surrey. An [elegant new theatre](http://www.grangeparkopera.co.uk/whp/the-theatre-in-the-woods/), set in the historic gardens of a beautiful 15th century manor house, will be the new home of this inimitable festival. As Fiona Maddocks of the Observer has noted, “Grange Park continues its unstoppable progress.”

With no Government support, the company, a registered charity, is funded by box office income, its donors and supporters.

The Company is limited by Guarantee and is registered in England and Wales Company No. 3490791.
