#### Who We Are

The New York Opera Alliance (NYOA) is a consortium of New York City opera companies and producers established to enhance and support the visibility and viability of opera in NYC. Founded in 2011, NYOA has grown from 4 organizations to more than 40, and counting. Since 2013, NYOA has been fiscally sponsored by OPERA America. 

We believe that New Yorkers and visitors to New York alike can be better informed about the breadth, range and vitality of New York City’s opera-producing community. NYOA is a community-driven organization; together, we aspire to increase awareness of participating organizations, share ideas and resources, and generate revenue for collaborative projects. 

#### What We Do

We hold quarterly meetings that include a workshop or presentation on a topic of interest to opera producers and artists, and a chance to engage with other participant organizations. In addition, we maintain a shared website with an online events calendar and publish a monthly e-newsletter about upcoming participant company events. 

In May & June, 2016, NYOA is producing the inaugural New York Opera Fest, open to all of our participant organizations, to bring increased visibility to opera in New York. 

#### Why Join?

NYOA offers many opportunities for professional development, increased recognition and publicity, festival participation, and engagement with other opera-makers and audiences. Perhaps more importantly, however, NYOA is building a community of collegiality and support — we believe our city is enriched and uplifted by cross-pollination between organizations, and we invite you to be part of the conversation. NYOA participation also provides access to limited Opera America benefits. 

Start your journey through the world of opera in New York City by visiting our Calendar and dedicated Participant pages.
