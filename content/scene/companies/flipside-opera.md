Flipside Opera is a non-profit organization dedicated to the performance of opera in Manitoba - up close and personal. We aim to offer a new perspective on classical music, to captivate the modern audience, and to provide performance opportunities to Manitoban artists.

We realized that Winnipeg needed an opera/art song collective that pushed the boundaries of the recital hall and the tradition of classical music.  

Our goal is simple: to provide the community with both traditional and accessible repertoire with a unique perspective.
