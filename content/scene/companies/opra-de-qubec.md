	The objective set by L'Opéra de Québec was to produce two major operas each season, drawing on the pool of talent already present in Québec City. The first production by the new company, Madame Butterfly, was presented in May 1985 and was warmly received, thanks in part to the magnificent performance by soprano Evelyne Brunner in the title role.

	Well-wishers from around the world expressed their support for the new venture, including Luciano Pavarotti, Jessye Norman, Placido Domingo, Jon Vickers, Wilhelmenia Fernandez, Pierrette Alarie and Léopold Simoneau. On the opening night, L'Opéra de Québec innovated by presenting the libretto in the form of French surtitles, the first time this had been attempted not only in Québec, but in the French-speaking world.
