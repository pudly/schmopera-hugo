For sixty-eight years, Opera Carolina has served this region with excellence on our mainstage, in our schools, and throughout the community. Our commitment to enriching the lives of citizens from all walks of life is deeply rooted in the history of our company – and it’s a commitment we take seriously.

Begun in 1948 by the Charlotte Music Club, today’s Opera Carolina was formed because a handful of arts lovers decided that Opera performances would enhance the community. In the early decades of Opera Carolina, volunteers designed the sets, built costumes, sang in the chorus, filled leading roles and, of course, sold tickets and held fundraisers to support the company.

Now a fully professional company that produces Opera performances and education programs at the highest level, we never forget the legacy of the original volunteers who made this company the outstanding community resource it has become today.

Opera Carolina is rooted in the Carolinas – 90% of our company live and work right here in our region, complementing the international artists who join the resident company to perform on our mainstage. This is our home, and we view our role in this community as a public trust that demands we be transformative, creative and committed to excellence – just as our first volunteers were.
