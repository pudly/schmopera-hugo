<p>
	<em>Opera Lyra</em> (OL) is one of the largest independent arts organizations in the National Capital Region. The company dared to be Ottawa's first professional opera company in 1984 and now, thirty years after staging our first production (Mozart's one-act opera <em>The Impresario</em> at the former York Street Theatre in Ottawa's Byward Market),<em>Opera Lyra </em>is proud to be presenting two main-stage productions each year on the prestigious stage of the National Arts Centre's Southam Hall.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Opera Lyra's</em> mandate is to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>produce and present opera productions of the highest quality in the National Capital Region;</li>
	<li>promote opera as an art form and make it as accessible to as large a segment of the population as possible through community outreach and education;</li>
	<li>and, wherever possible, encourage, nurture and support Canadian artists.</li>
</ul>
