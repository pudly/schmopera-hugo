Heralded as "an important tradition and a gift to the New York cultural scene," by Classical Music Editor Zachary Woolfe of *The New York Times*, Amore Opera has built a loyal following among opera lovers of all ages. Thanks to having inherited numerous sets and thousands of costumes from Amato Opera, Amore is able to offer fully-staged productions featuring a 30-member orchestra. Each year, Mr. Hull gives a platform to rising star singers, guest conductors, designers, directors, and, by maintaining a children's choir, offers opportunities for new opera aficionados and performers. In November 2017, in an interview for *Operawire*, Mr. Hull explained: "I'm really keen on educating the next generation of people on opera and classical music in general." In an effort to give more singers a chance to participate in a fully-staged live operatic production, Amore usually assigns several singers to each role, so the cast rotates with each performance.

"Much love and effort were lavished on the production," wrote James R. Oestreich in *The New York Times* about a rarely performed sequel to Mozart's *Die Zauberflöte* called *Das Labyrinth*, with libretto by Mozart’s collaborator Schikaneder and music by Peter von Winter. And, Classical Singer Magazine recently exclaimed, "All is not lost! The Amore Opera Takes Over!!"

During the 2018-19 season, Amore Opera will also present: a production of Puccini's *La Bohème* (December 21-31, 2018); a retelling of the classic Dickens Christmas tale, *Scrooge & Gilbert & Sullivan*, featuring the music of Gilbert & Sullivan with new book and lyrics by Artistic Director Nathan Hull (December 27-30, 2018); a new production of Giacomo Meyerbeer's unjustly neglected *L'Étoile du Nord* (March 19-23, 2019); a charming new two-hour English version of Mozart's *Così fan tutte* (March 15-24, 2019); Giuseppe Verdi's *Un ballo in maschera* (May 31-June 16, 2019); and a children’s production of Gilbert & Sullivan's *Iolanthe* (June 11 & 15, 2019).
