Busting the myth that contemporary opera is irrelevant, pretentious and unapproachable, creating work to feed your inner explorer, be you a connoisseur, opera virgin, or just simply curious.

A platform for emerging and established artists of all disciplines, no space is out of bounds; you’re as likely to find us performing in a warehouse or nightclub as you would in a theatre.  

We hope you join us for the ride.  We don't have a map, but you'll like where we're going.
