Translated without embellishment from the Italian, Opera da Camera means chamber (Camera) work (Opera). A musical work in a chamber… in a room. More importantly, it is a work that promotes a sense of closeness, intimacy, a connection resonating directly between the audience and the musician.

Since its foundation in 2011, Opera da Camera has been producing voice recitals that combine works of the classical and musical theatre genres in order to promote accessibility and encourage an understanding of the sung art forms. In 2013 the company broadened its mandate to include the presentation of a complete opera on a yearly basis. For its inaugural production, Opera da Camera chose Mozart's *Le Nozze di Figaro* which was received to great public and critic success. The performance was lauded in Opera Canada and roverarts.com, among others.
