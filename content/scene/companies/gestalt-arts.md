Gestalt means "The whole is more than the sum of the parts".

Gestalt is a creative company reinventing music theatre as a tool to transform, celebrate and unite unique sites and their communities. Through innovative partnerships, Gestalt creates a range of experiences from mini operas to sound installations and creative learning projects across the UK.

Gestalt has produced 4 operas to date, and from 2015 â€“ 2016 will be incubated by Guildhall School of Music and Drama and public art company Artichoke.
