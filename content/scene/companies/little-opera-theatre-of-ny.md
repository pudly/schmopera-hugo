The little OPERA theatre of ny (LOTNY) is a chamber opera company that was founded in September of 2004. The most recent production was the NY premiere of J.A. Hasse’s _Piramo e Tisbe_, was described as “superbly smart and affecting” by Parterre and “fit for a king” by ConcertoNet. The 2017 New York premiere of Carlisle Floyd’s _Prince of Players_ was widely praised, described by the New York Times as “well made and stylish.” Other recent productions include Chevalier de Saint-George’s _L’Amant Anonyme_, which was heralded as “an exercise in restrained beauty;” and the 2014 production of Carlisle Floyd’s _Slow Dusk & Markheim_ was warmly received, described as “ambitious and rewarding” by Opera News. 

Past seasons have included Rossini’s _Opportunity Makes the Thief_, a production that Opera News called a “lively and enlightening contribution… to New York City’s operatic life”; Gluck’s 1760 comic opera, _The Reformed Drunkard_; and a double bill entitled _Travelers_, which included two rarities by Gustav Holst (_The Wandering Scholar_ and _Sāvitri_). A “Critic’s Pick” in The New Yorker and The New York Times, _Travelers_ garnered critical praise. The NY Times commending the operas  “delicate balance of grandeur and intimacy.” 

In 2011, LOTNY presented the New York stage premiere of Mozart’s youthful opera, _Mitridate, re di Ponto_ to sold-out houses, and received widespread press coverage. Work with living composers include the production of Inessa Zaretsky’s _Man in a Black Coat_ as part of Target Margin’s _Last Futurist Lab_ at The Bushwick Starr. Concert presentations have included: _This Little Light of Mine: The Stories of Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price_ created by and featuring Adrienne Danrich presented at Merkin Concert Hall, _Make Believe: A tribute to Jerome Kern_, and _The Bohemians_ both presented at Socrates Sculpture Park.
