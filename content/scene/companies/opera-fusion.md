### Our mission

* To build new audiences for, and to introduce new generations to, the operatic art form;
* To create enlightening musical and theatrical events using the beauty, emotional quality, and expressiveness of the human voice with productions that are fresh and economically feasible; and
* To create opportunities for gifted local singers.

We believe the time is right for a fresh and lighter approach to opera and operatic presentations;

We've assembled an outstanding group of singers, musicians and business people to kick off this exciting new opera company, Opera Fusion Florida.
