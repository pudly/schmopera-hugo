<p>
	We're a collective of Toronto artists – actors, opera singers, musicians, painters, writers, dancers, and arts professionals with a thing for performing in unique spaces. We want to take the classics and turn them sideways – that is, present them... differently. Cozily. Sometimes with beer and popcorn.
</p>
<p>
	AtG's inaugural season in 2010/2011 included three critically acclaimed concert presentations and a fully staged production of<em>La Bohème</em>. We've presented sold-out concert performances of Kurt Weill's <em>The Seven Deadly Sins (and Holier Fare)</em>, a four-run production of Britten's <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> and last season's <em>Figaro's Wedding</em>, our fresh take on the Mozart classic, with a new English translation.
</p>
<p>
	AtG regulars have performed in very fine places – ornate halls and opera houses across this country, across the border and across the pond – and we love those audiences and that scene. But what we also love, and what we're yearning for, is intimacy. Smallness and coziness and being able to see every face in an audience.
</p>
<p>
	So what we're doing is our very best work, but in unconventional spaces and in unconventional ways. And you're invited to see how the experiment goes, friend.
</p>
