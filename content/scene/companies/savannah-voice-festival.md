The Savannah VOICE Festival is a non-profit arts organization that brings classical vocal excellence to the Savannah, Georgia area through a two-week celebration of concerts, events and educational presentations during the month of August and throughout the year.

The programs range from opera and classical music to musical theater and popular song, and offer accessible events to the public while highlighting the intrinsic value the vocal arts bring to the quality of life. Working with its sister organization, the VOICExperience Foundation, which helps young artists pursue their careers in the performing arts, the Festival annually serves over 100 artists, 5,000 audience members and provides over 45 events and community enrichments programs.

Now under the umbrella of The Sherrill Milnes VOICE Programs, both programs continue their dedication to the quality, integrity and perpetuation of the vocal arts through life–changing intensives, performances and community enriching outreach events in New York, Georgia, Florida and Illinois.

Both organizations were founded by opera legend Sherrill Milnes and soprano Maria Zouves. They work together to serve the community by providing the highest level of education and quality performances by talented artists for all to enjoy.
