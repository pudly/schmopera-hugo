<p>
	Essential Opera was founded in Toronto, ON, Canada by sopranos Erin Bardua and Maureen Batt, to give audiences and singers a chance to experience opera at its most essential. Following a successful February 2011 debut production of <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> (inarguably one of the most essential operas), we're making exciting plans for future seasons.
</p>
<p>
	We'll continue to bring together talented and passionate professional and emerging singers, expert music direction, and beautiful venues. We'll keep production costs (in other words, ticket prices) down by presenting these amazing works in concert. It's just the essentials: brilliant music, a libretto that's dramatic – or touching – or funny – or all three, and a great group of performers.
