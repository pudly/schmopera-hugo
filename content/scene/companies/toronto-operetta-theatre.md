<p>
	Toronto Operetta Theatre is Canada's only professional operetta company. TOT was launched with performances of Lehar's THE COUNT OF LUXEMBOURG in 1985 and was incorporated as a not-for-profit performing arts organization in 1989. Over 58 operetta productions have followed, including performances of seldom seen works such as CZARDAS PRINCESS, WIENER BLUT, LA VIE PARISIENNE, THE BEGGAR STUDENT, and LAND OF SMILES.
