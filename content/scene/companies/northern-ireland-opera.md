<p>
	Northern Ireland Opera, based at Belfast's historic Grand Opera House, has a mission to provide the highest-quality opera to the widest possible audience. With a philosophy of excellence and risk-taking underpinned by an imaginative programming policy and first-rate casting, Northern Ireland Opera is committed to opera as a unique art form.
</p>
<p>
	By keeping ticket-prices affordable, and through the regular (but not exclusive) use of English in performances, we are committed to widening the audience for opera: everyone will be welcome to our productions, from young to old, rich to poor, and from traditional opera-goers to those who have never seen an opera in their life before.
