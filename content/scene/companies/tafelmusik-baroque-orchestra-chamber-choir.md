<p>
	The word is German and means "table music" or "music for the feast."
</p>
<p>
	The name is apt because Tafelmusik has produced a feast of firsts and bests, and has won admiration throughout the musical world.
</p>
<p>
	Tafelmusik's vision is to be an international centre of excellence in period performance for generations to come. To sustain this vision, Tafelmusik is now creating artists and audiences for the future through artist training and audience development activities.
</p>
<p>
	Tafelmusik's mission is to engage audiences locally, provincially, nationally and internationally with historically informed live and recorded musical experiences on period instruments.
