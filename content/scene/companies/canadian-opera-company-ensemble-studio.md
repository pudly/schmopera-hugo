<p>
	The COC Ensemble Studio — founded in 1980 with a generous continuing grant from Imperial Oil Limited and with assistance from the Government of Canada — is Canada's premier training program for young opera professionals.
</p>
<p>
	It provides advanced instruction, hands-on experience, and the practical career development skills necessary to succeed as a self-employed artist in a highly competitive international environment.
</p>
<p>
	The Ensemble is chosen through a national audition process. Members of the Ensemble Studio receive a blend of advanced study and practical experience. In this one-to-three-year program, singers receive vocal, theatrical and practical career development instruction.
</p>
<p>
	Their practical experience includes understudying major roles, the annual Glencore Ensemble School tour, special Ensemble Studio chamber productions and a special Ensemble Studio performance of a COC mainstage production as well as roles in COC mainstage productions.
</p>
<p>
	Apprentice stage directors, conductors and vocal coaches participate in the preparation of the company's mainstage productions, as well as School Tour performances and Ensemble Studio productions.
