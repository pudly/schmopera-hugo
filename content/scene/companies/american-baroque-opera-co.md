Established in 2017, the American Baroque Opera Co. presents to Dallas audiences intimate staged productions of operas from the Baroque era.   In addition to presenting works of well known composers including Handel, Vivaldi, and Purcell, our mission is to resurrect the operas of lesser known baroque composers, famous in their day, whose operas have fallen into obscurity.  We present our productions on period instruments with authentic historical performance practice, and are excited to educate and entertain new audiences with these masterpieces of the baroque.
