We are a Multi-disciplinary Music Theatre production company based in Toronto, Canada. 

Founded by Operatic Stage Director Anna Theodosakis (COC, U of T Opera, MYOpera) and Collaborative Pianist Hyejin Kwon (COC Ensemble, Lyric Opera Baltimore), We strive to showcase unheard voices in the Indie opera scene in Toronto, and seek out talented individuals across artistic mediums who inspire us to collaborate and tell feminist stories in unique ways.
