<p>
	Opera North is England's national opera company in the North and one of Europe's leading arts organisations. The Company is committed to producing work of the highest quality that excites, challenges and entertains. It tours not only throughout the North of England and to London, but also to opera houses on the continent in cities such as Prague and Barcelona, and it performs at major international festivals including Edinburgh and Ravenna.
</p>
<p>
	Opera North is a vibrant, lively organisation which actively challenges conventional perceptions of opera. Breathing new life into the classics, the Company is also a strong advocate of lesser-known works and a champion of musical theatre.
