Embarking on its sixth season of producing immersive site-specific opera, On Site Opera (OSO) has established itself as one of New York City’s most imaginative, nimble opera companies by doing more than simply staging musically and dramatically rich works outside of the opera house. OSO’s team of General & Artistic Director, Eric Einhorn, Music Director, Geoffrey McDonald, and Executive Director/Producer, Jessica Kiger have pushed the boundaries of operatic storytelling, producing operas in locations that allow singers and audiences alike to immerse themselves in the narrative. Reviewing the first chapter of *The Figaro Project*, in which OSO is staging lesser-known operatic adaptations of French playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais’ (1732-1799) famed trilogy of Figaro plays, Anthony Tommasini of *The New York Times* wrote, “This visionary company could be on to something big.” He also noted that the “space proved ideal for the intrigues of the opera.”

OSO has presented Shostakovich at The Bronx Zoo, Gershwin at Harlem’s legendary Cotton Club, Rameau at Madame Tussauds New York and the Lifestyle-Trimco mannequin showroom, Paisiello at Fabbri Mansion, Portugal at 632 on Hudson as well as a site-specific workshop of *Clarimonde*, a new work by Frederic Chaslin and P.H. Fisher. Committed to exploring new technology in opera, OSO implemented the first-ever Google Glass supertitles during its 2014 run of Rameau’s *Pygmalion*, of which The Verge reported “Few things seem like obvious fits for Google Glass so far, but this is one of them.”

Founded in 2012, OSO is dedicated to producing site-specific opera in non-traditional venues throughout New York. OSO molds its productions to specific locations using physical space to create an environment in which the concept, storytelling, music, and performers unite to form an immersive, cohesive, and meaningful whole. OSO, a registered 501(c)(3), is a proud member of Opera America and the New York Opera Alliance.
