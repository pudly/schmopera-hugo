Opera Mariposa is a Vancouver-based company run by young artists, for young artists. Our mission is to create a stage for emerging talent, showcasing the most promising performers from across North America and beyond in a diverse program of gala concerts, charity benefits, original shows and fully staged opera and musical theatre productions. 

Now in our sixth season, our performances have been hailed as “a stroke of genius” (The Voice), “an evening of delight” and “a masterpiece” (Review Vancouver), with The Vancouver Project declaring that “Opera Mariposa stands at the forefront of Vancouver’s opera scene.“ Our innovative programming presents classic works alongside new shows and rarely-staged gems, allowing us to offer singers a unique range of artistic opportunities while creating productions that engage both dedicated music lovers and new audiences.
