Founded in Quebec in 2000 by individually renowned dancers/choreographers Bill Coleman and Laurence Lemieux, Coleman Lemieux & Compagnie (CLC) has distinguished itself by its innovative, unbridled artistic vision.  CLC creates, produces and presents varied works on a local, national and international scale.

The Company has toured across Canada, into the United States (where they headlined the Jacobâ€™s Pillow Festival and appeared at Fall for Dance in New York City and in several other major cities), and to Brazil, China, Russia and was the first modern dance company to perform in Mongolia.
