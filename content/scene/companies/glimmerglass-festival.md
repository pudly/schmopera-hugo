<p>
	Glimmerglass Opera came into being through the efforts of Cooperstown residents – musicians, artists, educators and lovers of the art form – who hoped to bring opera to their community.
</p>
<p>
	The company continues its tradition of four new fully staged productions, now including three operas and one work of American musical theater, performed with full orchestra, large cast and no sound amplification. These four productions are supplemented by special performances, concerts, lectures and symposiums throughout the season. The company continues to attract an international audience to the scenic Cooperstown area, where the talent of singers, directors, designers and staff from around the world converges in the Alice Busch Opera Theater to produce world-class opera and music theater.
