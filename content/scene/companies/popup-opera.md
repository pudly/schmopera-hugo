Pop-up Opera is an innovative touring opera company dedicated to making opera enjoyable and inviting, without losing the quality of musical performance. We aim to broaden the appeal of opera and to challenge the way opera is performed, by taking it into unusual spaces and making it fun, fresh and intimate.

Our productions are fully staged, then adapted to each new space we go into, making every performance unique. Performances showcase exciting new operatic talent, professional opera singers in the first stage of promising careers. We aim to bring pleasure to those who are hesitant about opera, as well as to dedicated opera lovers; to open the hidden door to this art form and make even more seasoned opera goers feel like they have been given a secret backstage pass.

Our venues are an important part of what we create. We take our productions beyond just the traditional theatres and informal pubs: a boat made of scrap metal, a restored Victorian poorhouse, a cylindrical shaft beneath the Thames, a cider barn, a winery and even 100 ft underground in candlelit caverns. In these extraordinary venues, the music, storytelling and the electrifying performances of the singers have our audiences enthralled.
