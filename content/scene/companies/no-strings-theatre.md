### Our Mission Statement

No Strings Theatre is a registered not-for-profit charitable organization with a mission to provide opportunity for young people to develop their skills in all aspects of the music theatre arts—singing, dancing, acting, production—under the guidance of trained professional artists.

Our target ages are Pre-teen Prep (10-12), Young Company (13-21), Emerging Professional Artists (21-30)

### Our Inspiration

One afternoon during a voice lesson the idea occurred to us that there are a limitted number of professional musical theatre community programs for teens in the Toronto area. So what was our solution? Create one ourselves. We knew many teenagers in the Toronto area who loved to perform but hardly get the opportunity or find that they want to improve on their skills in the less hectic summer months. We, therefore, started a program where teens can improve on music theatre skills and learn to work with a team to successfully put on a co-operative production. This program would not have been possible without the help of dozens of teenagers who taught us that there is nothing better than giving someone the opportunity to take a bow.

### Our Creative Team

Our creative team and instructional team are established industry professionals in Dance, Drama and Singing with many years of performance and or teaching experience in their fields and with this targeted age group.

### Our Staff to Student Ratio

Enrollment is limited to 40-50 participants to ensure that each student is challenged to meet their goals. Our tiered system of directors, associates, interns and assistants create staff to student ratios between 1:5-1:10 for any given program.
