Skylark Opera Theatre is:

Dedicated to providing its audience with performances of the highest artistic quality, brought to the stage by the best in musical and technical talent both nationally and locally. The organization has been known for a wide-ranging repertoire of opera and musical theater, while emphasizing strongly balanced musical and theatrical values. The repertoire has included a unique mix of familiar favorites and new work, including many productions that are new to the Twin Cities’ stage.  

Committed to patron accessibility: all performances are in English, and are performed in intimate venues in the Twin Cities and around the region. By maintaining year-round programming at affordable ticket prices (with discounts available for students, seniors, and other selected patron categories), it is able to fulfill another of its key missions: to create and develop an appreciation for opera and musical theater genres that spans multiple generations.

Led by a professional management team and made up of a volunteer working Board of Directors, Skylark Opera Theatre is housed at Landmark Center in St. Paul and performs throughout the Twin Cities. Its current patron base is roughly one third residents of St. Paul and the eastern suburbs and two-thirds from Minneapolis and the west.
