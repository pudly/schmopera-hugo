## Mission Statement

City Lyric Opera provides a one-of-a-kind experience for audience members by welcoming them to the operatic art form without judgment, expectation, or financial burden.

## Positioning Statement

City Lyric Opera was created to redefine the way opera is perceived and produced. We put the artist first because we believe that a welcoming and collaborative environment enables them to give a better, more genuine experience to audience members. Enthusiasm and creativity are infectious and we want everyone to be able to enjoy the opera. We produce high-quality art at affordable prices to ensure a welcoming and diverse experience both on and offstage. 

## Who Are We?

We founded City Lyric Opera in the fall of 2016 under the name of ARE Opera. As ARE Opera, it was our mission to produce opera that was Accessible, Relatable, and Enjoyable to all audience members no matter their age, background, or experience with the art form. As we grew, we watched the mission transform before our eyes. Though we focused much of our time on the presentation to our audiences, we found that in order to effectively achieve our mission we had to think about the artist as well. This shift in focus allowed us to better to serve our artists while creating more authentic performances that brought in audience members of all ages, backgrounds, and experiences. After two thrilling and successful seasons, we decided to rebrand as City Lyric Opera. We believe this name better reflects the community and the artists whom we serve.

## How Do We Do It?

* We provide performance and networking opportunities for aspiring professionals in New York City
* We work to diversify the average opera audience through outreach, public concerts, and special events
* We sponsor, host, and/or participate in events that promote the operatic art form
* We cultivate multi-disciplinary relationships throughout the performing and visual arts communities
