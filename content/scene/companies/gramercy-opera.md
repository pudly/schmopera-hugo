#### Our Mission

To promote emerging artists through operatic productions and to collaborate with various art forms encouraging a community of artists working together with the purpose of entertaining audiences in a way that is accessible, inclusive and engaging. 

#### Who We Are

We're new and we're here and we're ready to entertain.

Gramercy Opera is a brand new NYC based Opera Company. We are a company born out of a passionate love for opera and the burning desire to switch things up and raise the stakes. 
We value vulnerability, passion and art. We respect all artists and believe in the power and importance of supporting and embracing emerging and upcoming artists. Our company encourages vocalists to incorporate movement and interpretation into their performances in a manner that strays from convention -but above all, singers that love what they do and have fun doing it. 

#### Our History

Gramercy is an area of NYC on the East Side between 14th and 23rd streets and 1st Ave. and Park Ave S. Calling it "a Victorian gentleman who has refused to die", Charlotte Devree in the New York Times said that "There is nothing else quite like Gramercy Park in the country." We connect with that. We think we represent an art form that refuses to die, refuses to be irrelevant and refuses to be anything but spectacular. 

The key in our logo is in reference to the historic Gramercy Park: a private park in the heart of Gramercy that requires a key to be admitted. While we are not an exclusive, but an INCLUSIVE company, we do fancy ourselves the key holders of new age opera...and we're here to stay.
