<p>
	FAWN Chamber Creative is a Toronto-based collective dedicated to expanding the audience for Canadian classical music, with an emphasis on bringing new opera and new multi-disciplinary works to the stage. FAWN's principal focus is the commissioning and presentation of new chamber music and operas by Canadian composers. In its productions, FAWN seeks to incorporate the work of artists in other fields, with the goal of bridging the gap between historically siloed audiences. By pairing new music with interdisciplinary productions, FAWN hopes to reach new audiences who are artistically inclined but may not have a pre-existing connection to new classical music.
