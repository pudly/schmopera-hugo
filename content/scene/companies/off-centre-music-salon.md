Off Centre Music Salon presents classical music in an innovative atmosphere that evokes the spirit of a 19th century European salon.

Held on Sunday afternoons at Torontoâ€™s Trinity-St. Paul's Centre, Off Centre seeks to inspire, educate and entertain by drawing connections between music, history, literature, art, design, and theatre through informative mini-lectures, readings by eminent Canadian scholars and performers.
