<p>
	The Bicycle Opera Project is a group of young professional artists dedicated to bringing high-quality, accessible opera to communities across Ontarioâ€¦ traveling exclusively by bicycle!
</p>
<p>
	Through our passion for representing contemporary Canadian music, we aim to give the age-old art form a new spin, by introducing audiences to a wealth of fabulous contemporary operatic works. In keeping with our mission to make opera accessible, we perform only in English, in intimate and unique venues, with a variety of dramatic content relevant to todays audiences.
