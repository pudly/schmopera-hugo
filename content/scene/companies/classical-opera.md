Established in 1997 Classical Opera is one of the leading exponents of the music of Mozart and his contemporaries.

Under the direction of founder and conductor Ian Page, and with our own specialist and highly acclaimed period-instrument orchestra, we regularly present benchmark performances of operas and orchestral works in some of London’s most prestigious venues and, increasingly, abroad. We attract extensive critical and public acclaim for the high quality of our performances on CD and in the concert hall, for our intelligent and imaginative programming, and for our ability to discover and nurture world-class young singers.

In 2012 we embarked on an unprecedented recording cycle of the complete Mozart Operas (20 releases in total, released at the rate of one a year), and in 2015 we launched our ground-breaking MOZART 250, described by *The Observer* as “among the most audacious classical music scheduling ever”. MOZART 250 sets out to explore the music that was being written by Mozart and his contemporaries exactly 250 years previously, following the trajectory of his life, works and influences in chronological sequence. Spanning 27 years – from the 250th anniversary of his childhood visit to London to the 250th anniversary of his death – we will aim to re-tread the steps of musical history, examining, contextualising and celebrating the life of arguably the greatest composer ever to have lived.
