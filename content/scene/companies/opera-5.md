<p>
	Walk into any opera house and look around. In one word, what do you see? Old? Money? Snobs? Intellect? Elite?
</p>
<p>
	When you think of opera as an art form, do you think of Bugs Bunny in bull horns, or a guy in a speedo selling gum? Maybe you're thinking of Italian food?
</p>
<p>
	At Opera Five we believe that opera is all these things, but that it can be so much more. It's an art form that has unlimited potential, that has inspired artists for centuries, an art form we love and most importantly one that can move any audience, period.
