The Bregenz Festival pledged to contribute € 3 million itself to the project for the renovation and enlargement of the Festspielhaus in 2005 and 2006. The festival was able to raise this sum by means of a fund-raising campaign, thanks in particular to the generosity and solidarity of a great many donors.

The Bregenz Festival owes a debt of gratitude towards the companies, foundations and private individuals as well as to the many "seat sponsors" in the TAKE A SEAT initiative whose combined donations made it possible to reach the agreed sum in time.
