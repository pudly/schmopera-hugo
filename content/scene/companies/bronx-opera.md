The Bronx Opera Company (BxO) is the only opera company in NYC (other than the Met) to have produced each year since we were founded in 1967. BxO’s mission is to present operas as fully integrated works of musical theater set to great music by great composers (known and unknown) and to broaden the audience for our art form. This broadening is accomplished by keeping ticket prices low (there is no ticket to a Bronx Opera performance that costs more than $45); by performing all operas in English; and by the work we do with Schools and Community Organizations in The Bronx.  All of this work strengthens BxO, enabling us to carry the banner of The Bronx throughout the area and, by reputation, around the country and the world.  All productions are sung in English and are performed with full orchestra and chorus, fully staged and costumed. The company is open to all individuals to participate based on their talents and availability. The inclusiveness is reflected both onstage and in the audience; in the words of Opera News Online, “The Bronx Opera’s crowd, like the company’s enthusiastic, sonorous chorus, is (hearteningly) among the most racially integrated to be seen in New York; encouraging the attendance of so many young people marks a positive contribution to the art form.”
