Collectìf is dedicated to exploring and expanding the world of art song performance
by presenting innovative, song-based theatre. In the 2015/16 season our main series presented a newly compiled pastiche *Le Rossignol et la Rose* and a staged interpretation of Schubert's *Winterreise* in *As a Stranger*. Have a look at all of our previous projects here!

This season, we are working on a brand new pastiche called Fête that we will be producing in 2017/18. To stay up to date with our work please follow us on your preferred social media platform @collectifto.
