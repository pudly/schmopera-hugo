Opera Kelowna is a registered, non-profit, charitable status society and member of the Canadian Association of Professional Opera Companies.

Opera Kelowna is dedicated to equipping, educating, enlightening, enriching and entertaining diverse audiences through professional operatic performing arts and programming.

Founding Artistic Director, [Alexandra Babbel](http://www.operakelowna.com/about/artistic-director/), is committed to building an opera company that continues to transform the musical and cultural landscape of our region.

[The performing season](http://www.operakelowna.com/the-season/) is focused on one fully staged and orchestrated professional opera each season with plans to add a second main-stage production in future seasons.

Additional operatic expressions including concerts and outdoor presentations round out the season.

The society offers high-level education and outreach. Opera Kelowna’s [Summer Intensive Training Program](http://www.operakelowna.com/education/summer-intensive-training-program/) transitions vocal artists and collaborative pianists from their academic to professional careers. Internships in directing, conducting, costume design and accompanying are offered each season.
