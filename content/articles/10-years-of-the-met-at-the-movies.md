>"When the program first launched our audiences thanked their local managers personally.  For many who live outside major metropolitan centres getting to live opera was almost impossible. They relied on old broadcasts on public television.  Seeing The Met Live in HD was a first for many and especially those who can’t afford the cost of tickets, flights and hotels to make it to Lincoln Centre themselves. Cineplex is proud to have been be bringing these live performances to audiences for the past ten years." - Brad LaDouceur, Vice President, Event Cinema, Cineplex Entertainment

The Met's 10th season of Live in HD is full of opportunities to bring a newbie to the theatre and be wowed. Personally, I can't wait for the crazy ladies in *Lulu* and *Elektra*, but [click here](https://cineplexfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/Events/MetOpera/2016/MET_Opera_LiveInHD-FINAL.pdf) for the full season brochure and decide for yourself.

See you at the movies!
