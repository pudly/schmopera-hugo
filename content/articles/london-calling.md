Well, readers, after much anticipation and a slight delay, Schmopera has made it to London. It's an amazing thing to be in a city with not only a myriad of opera companies large and small, but great pickings of arts and cultural centres offering up a buffet of musical options.

We can't wait to catch [*Il trittico*](http://www.roh.org.uk/mixed-programmes/il-trittico) at the Royal Opera House, and tenor [Paul Appleby's recital](https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/lachner-schumann-wolf-and-more-201603041930) with Malcolm Martineau at Wigmore Hall (the first of, hopefully, many recitals at the famed recital space). 

On top of that, there are arts centres like the overwhelming [Barbican](http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/classical.asp) and its offerings of Renée Fleming in recital, Gustavo Dudamel's Los Angeles Philharmonic, plus some pretty stunning Brutalist architecture. There's [Royal Albert Hall](http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/), where one can catch everything from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to Cirque du Soleil. There's the [Southbank Centre](http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson), where Karita Mattila sings *Jenůfa* with the Czech Philharmonic, Angela Gheorgiu appears in recital, and Opera North presents Wagner's *Ring Cycle*. 

Perhaps we'll take a tour of the stunning London Coliseum, home of [English National Opera](/scene/companies/english-national-opera/), before catching their upcoming productions of *Norma* and Philip Glass' *Akhnaten*. 

Also, after some online digging, we found out that we're pretty curious about opera companies like [Opera Holland Park](http://www.operahollandpark.com/), [Mahogany Opera Group](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/), [D'Oyly Carte Opera Company](http://www.doylycarte.org.uk/) and [Pop-up Opera](http://popupopera.co.uk/about-us).

So, we'd like to extend a heartfelt "hello" to all the organizations and artists that keep all of this magic happening in such great numbers. We can't wait to get our butts in those seats. 

\*Shameless yet necessary post-script: Stephen Fry, if you're reading this, I will be your opera date any old time.
