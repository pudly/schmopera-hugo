short_description: The Rattler is terrifying, in a way that would make the Brothers
  Grimm proud. The Rattler himself is a puppet, a confusing and repulsive thing that
  calls to mind Egyptian mummies, Disney&#039;s The Skeleton Dance, and the big hyena
  scene from The Lion King. Singers double as puppeteers, their Rattler-work resulting
  in hysterical shrieks from the young audience. Martin Riley adapts the story into
  a libretto, and Stephen Deazley&#039;s music covers everything from plaintive folk
  songs to familiar jigs; as any good show should be, the music is catchy yet smart,
  singer-friendly yet arguably not easy.

Last week at the Southbank Centre, [Mahogany Opera Group](/scene/companies/mahogany-opera-group/) previewed its current kid-friendly production, [*The Rattler*](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/the-rattler/). Directed by Mahogany AD [Frederic Wake-Walker](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/the-rattler/company/frederic-wake-walker/), *The Rattler* is an interactive re-telling of the tale of Rumpelstiltskin. Remember *Rumpelstiltskin*, one of the Brothers Grimm's terrifying "children's stories"? There's the daughter who may or may not be able to spin straw into gold, and the mysterious, imp-like creature that helps her live up to her legend, essentially by getting her to write him a blank cheque, post-dated at the creature's discretion.

*The Rattler* is terrifying, in a way that would make the Brothers Grimm proud. The Rattler himself is a puppet, a confusing and repulsive thing that calls to mind Egyptian mummies, Disney's [*The Skeleton Dance*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h03QBNVwX8Q), and the big hyena scene from *The Lion King*. Singers double as puppeteers, their Rattler-work resulting in hysterical shrieks from the young audience. [Martin Riley](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/the-rattler/company/martin-riley/) adapts the story into a libretto, and [Stephen Deazley](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/the-rattler/company/stephen-deazley/)'s music covers everything from plaintive folk songs to familiar jigs; as any good show should be, the music is catchy yet smart, singer-friendly yet arguably not easy.

This week, the show begins an [extended tour](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/the-rattler/dates-and-tickets/) for young audiences throughout the UK. The cast and creative team make an experience out of their performance; the shows include time for the young listeners to make their own instruments (a daring move, to give homemade percussion equipment to kids before they settle down for a show), learn some tunes from the show (with the help of baritone and endless ball of energy, [Matthew Sharp](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/the-rattler/company/matthew-sharp/)), and take a quick tour of the expansive Southbank Centre. Performing for kids is a feat in itself, and Mahogany's plan to include educational bonuses like this make the cast a inspiring, tireless group.

We wish the team a great tour. With a strong cast, sets and costumes full of eye candy, and an accessible score, *The Rattler* should get its fair share of audience reactions. An audience of kids give the most honest feedback you can get; judging from the preview, the feedback is overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Bravi, team, and safe travels!
