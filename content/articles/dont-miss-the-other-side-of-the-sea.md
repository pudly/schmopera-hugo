Following the critical acclaim of her 2016 one-woman opera, [*Scenes From the End*](/in-review-scenes-from-the-end/) [Héloïse Werner](/talking-with-singers-heloise-werner/) is set to present her new work for voice and cello, *The Other Side of the Sea*.

Werner is a Paris-born soprano with an extraordinary predisposition for creativity. Aided by a short gig as an *au pair* in the UK, and studying music at Cambridge University, the native French-speaker now also speaks fluent English. It's her bilingualism that inspired *The Other Side of the Sea*, a piece which uses the metaphor of the sea "to explore the tension of an identity split linguistically".

*The Other Side of the Sea* was developed in 2017 at a [Snape Maltings](https://snapemaltings.co.uk/music/residencies/) residency, with Werner as soprano and cellist, writer Octavia Bright, filmmaker Jessie Rodger, and director Emily Burns. 

The opera comes to London's [Cockpit Theatre on **July 2, 8pm**](https://www.thecockpit.org.uk/show/the_other_side_of_the_sea), and then to [Aldeburgh Parish Church on **July 7, 7pm**](https://snapemaltings.co.uk/whats-on/heloise-werner-hermes-experiment/).
