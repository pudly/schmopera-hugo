preamble: "Opera lovers are people who crave a great story, just like bookworms crave
  a page-turning novel to devour. I often wonder, when I watch a movie or TV show
  or read a book, how some of my favourite stories would translate into an operatic
  telling. The [Royal Opera House wondered this too](http://www.roh.org.uk/news/world-book-day-which-books-would-you-love-to-turn-into-an-opera-or-ballet),
  on World Book Day, and they reached out to Twitter for answers. \n\nOperas adapted
  from books aren't a new idea; Jennifer Higdon's opera *Cold Mountain* is based on
  Charles Frazier's award-winning novel of the same name, and Lorin Maazel composed
  *1984* based on Orwell's classic. \n\nOf course, not every work of fiction lends
  itself well to the addition of music; an operatic *Finnegan's Wake* might not be
  boring, but it may miss the point. Authors like John Irving write compelling characters
  (I could read *The World According to Garp* a hundred times), but they're developed
  over the long-haul, over a scope that's not conducive to the way opera tells stories.
  The same goes for delicious epics, like *Harry Potter*, *The Lord of the Rings*,
  *A Song of Ice and Fire*, and even Diana Gabaldon's *Outlander* series; there are
  opera-sized events in these books, and though there's potential for Wagner's-*Ring*-*Cycle*-like
  operatic takes on them, there's likely too much detail involved to really do justice
  to their complex webs of plots and characters.\n\nStill, some of our favourite books,
  and the characters in them, seem perfect for an opera. Examples, you ask?"

## *Lord of the Flies*

William Golding's 1954 novel was a staple of high school English class, a commentary on humans, society, and whether or not people think for themselves and feel empathy for others. It's already been [adapted for the stage](http://lordoftheflies.co.uk/) by Nigel Williams, and *Lord of the Flies* would be an amazing ensemble opera. In a story with so many symbols, there are huge opportunities for musical motives (French horn as conch shell?) and Britten-like personalities among the boys. Very *Billy Budd*, but on a beach. Piggy could be a character tenor, with baritone Ralph taking on the role of island government. Jack Merridew could be one hell of a countertenor role. Plus, there are three choirboys; I mean, *come on*.

## *The BFG*

One of the cornerstone stories of my childhood, Roald Dahl's 1982 children's book, *The BFG* (short for Big Friendly Giant), would make a beautiful opera for audiences of all ages. Perhaps the next great soubrette role could be Sophie, the little orphaned girl who gets plucked out of her bed one night by the BFG (but also rescued from the mean lady at the orphanage, Mrs. Clonkers). The Giant himself could be a glorious bass, a little like the title character in Massenet's *Don Quichotte*. There are mean giants, too; the Bloodbottler and the Fleshlumpeater are potentially the Fasolt and Fafner of the 21st century.

## *American Psycho*

True, there's a Broadway musical based on Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 story of New York City yuppie society and what the game does to the hardest of players. The music could be a cool, intertwining homage to some of Bateman's favourite artists, like Huey Lewis & the News and Phil Collins. I hear Patrick Bateman as a piercing bass, sort of like the cold steel in John Relyea's voice. Find a coloratura soprano for his girlfriend, Evelyn, a mezzo for his secretary, Jean, some lyric soprano lines for his women of the night, and an endless trail of clone baritones to sing Timothy Price, Paul Allen, and every other faceless Wall Street guy in a great suit and a white business card. Speaking of which, can we get someone to write "The Business Card Quartet"?

## *The Beach*

Another opportunity for some cool ensemble writing could be an operatic version of Alex Garland's 1996 novel, *The Beach*. There's a noble quest to find a better society, making the protagonist some sort of na√Øve leading tenor. There's an ambiguously benevolent "tribe" leader named Sal, perhaps singing with a very Mother-Superior type of rich mezzo. Plus, a pack of colourful backpackers, sung by comprimarios of all *fachs*, making up the isolated colony in Thailand with high hopes of utopianism. Very kumbayah-gone-wrong, with a globe's worth of musical references within the international group of world-travellers. "Trio of the Three Swedes", anyone?

## *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream*

It's true that opera might be a difficult genre in which to tell the entirety of Hunter S. Thompson's drug-fuelled, quasi auto-biographical romp through Nevada. Yet, I see it as a hazy story, with the music taking on the brunt of the surrealist, blurred reality of Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo. Think about it: bizarre duets in that desert-bound convertible, casino sounds morphing in the LSD fog, and the potential for a chorus of porcine police officers. It should probably be written by Mark-Anthony Turnage, too.
