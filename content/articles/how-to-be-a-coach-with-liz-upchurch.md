Liz Upchurch is a pianist, vocal coach, and the Head of the [COC Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx). She's in demand as a coach across Canada, working regularly at places like the St. Andrew by-the-Sea Opera Workshop and the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy, and she was a judge for the Bravo! TV show,*Bathroom Divas: So You Want To Be An Opera Star?* As a young pianist myself, I had some of my lightbulb moments in the studio with Liz, and I know she's as passionate an educator as she is a [performer](http://schmopera.com/in-review-jane-archibald-and-liz-upchurch/). She gave me a wonderful interview about pianists who work with singers, and how the two can inform each other.
