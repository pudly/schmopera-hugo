Soprano Cree Carrico thinks outside the box. Case in point: _The Ophelia Project_. With director Christopher Mirto, she has created _[The Ophelia Project](http://entertainmentdrivethru.com/cree-carrico/)_, a one-woman opera/theatre hybrid exploring the fractured psyche of Shakespeare's Ophelia. The piece stars Cree Carrico and pianist Kyung-Eun Na, and it's an exciting way to develop the "traditional" recital format. Cree's own history as a performer includes operatic roles like Vitellia (_La clemenza di Tito_) and Marie Antoinette (_Ghosts of Versailles_), and plenty of theatre experience to boot, like _Carousel_ with the New York Philharmonic (and Nathan Gunn!) and _Flora the Red Menace _ with Oberlin College Theatre.

I had the chance to work with Cree at Oberlin College Conservatory a few years back. She's insatiably creative, and she's fascinated with intertwining music and text. She created a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1780837189/the-ophelia-project) campaign for _The Ophelia Project;_ I asked her all about how the project formed, and why Cree and Ophelia get along so well.
