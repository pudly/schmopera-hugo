Every once in a while, I dig around for full-length operas available on YouTube; I get more and more pleasantly surprised at what's been uploaded by friendly strangers from the Internet. Today's pick is one of my favourites: the 1966 BBCtv production of Britten's _Billy Budd_. It's conducted by Charles Mackerras, with Peter Glossop in the title character and the incomparable Peter Pears as Captain Vere. It's a gem; enjoy it.
