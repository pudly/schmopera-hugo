Performer, teacher and artist educator Kyra Millan has taught countless students of all ages in school classrooms and in her private studio. She started the GLEESICAL music theatre program at the Classical Music Conservatory, and she leads workshops at the Canadian Opera Company, Opera Atelier, the Royal Conservatory of Music, Workman Arts, and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. 

Kyra collaborates with pianist [Christina Faye](http://www.christinamfaye.com/), and in 2015/16 they will be touring their opera comedy show "Millan and Faye", including a lunchtime concert at the [Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries.aspx) in March. Keep your eyes on [Kyra's website](http://kyra-millan.com/) for some "opera shenanigans" this month.

Kyra approaches arts education with warmth and joy, and she has contagious enthusiasm for bringing people out of their shells. I spoke to her about her work with aspiring singers, and what she learns from teaching.
