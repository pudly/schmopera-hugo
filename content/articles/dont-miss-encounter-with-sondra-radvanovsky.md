This fall, 10 singers will have the chance to work with famed soprano [Sondra Radvanovsky](/scene/people/sondra-radvanovsky/) in Toronto, between performances of Bellini's *Norma* with the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/).

The [International Resource Centre for Performing Artists](http://ircpa.net/) presents an *Encounter with Sondra Radvanovsky*, **October 12** at Alliance Française, 24 Spadina Rd., Toronto. 10 promising singers will be chosen by a panel of some of Canada's leading artists; they'll have the chance to work with Radvanovsky in a working session, and ask her questions about her career and the operatic industry. Scholarships for the 10 singers are provided by the *Name a Scholarship* campaign, to fund the development of emerging young artists.

Singers interested in participating in *Encounter with Sondra Radvanovsky* must [complete the sign-up form](http://ircpa.net/new_site/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Singer-Sign-up-Encounter-Sondra-Radvanovsky.pdf) on the IRCPA's website **before September 20**. Membership to the IRCPA is required, but free of charge. Singers who apply, but are not chosen to participate, will be invited to sit in and observe for a fee of $50.

The public will have a chance to hear these young singers in concert on **October 22**, at the IRCPA's *Singing Stars of Tomorrow*. At the concert, one singer will be given the opportunity to attend a 3-day workshop at OPERA America's [*Career Blueprints*](http://operaamerica.org/content/about/artists/CareerBlueprints.aspx); the workshop allows singers to build their professional package, offering headshots, audio/video recording time, website design, feedback on résumés, and panel discussions.

Singers, [sign up now](http://ircpa.net/new_site/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Singer-Sign-up-Encounter-Sondra-Radvanovsky.pdf); you don't want to pass on the chance to work with Radvanovsky, whose career speaks for itself. For singer fans, the October 22nd concert is a great chance to hear new voices at exciting stages of their development.

Tickets for *Singing Stars of Tomorrow* go on sale in September. Visit [IRCPA's website](http://ircpa.net/) for updates.
