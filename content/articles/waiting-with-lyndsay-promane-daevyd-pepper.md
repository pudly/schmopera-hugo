Mezzo-soprano [Lyndsay Promane](/scene/people/lyndsay-promane/) and tenor [Daevyd Pepper](/scene/people/daevyd-pepper/) are getting ready to present *Waiting: a recital*, on June 13th at 7:30, Islington United Church, with pianist [Natasha Fransblow](https://twitter.com/tashfrans). The recital is to help Lynsday and Daevyd to raise funds for their trip to Sulmona, Italy, where they'll train and gain stage experience at the [Centre for Opera Studies in Italy](/scene/companies/cosi-centre-for-opera-studies-in-italy/). Lyndsay, Daevyd, and Natasha will present works by Ravel, Tosti, G&S, and more.

Fundraising concerts are often the first time young singers are creating their own performance opportunities. I asked Daevyd and Lyndsay how producing your own concert can be an eye-opening experience for young artists.

Admission for *Waiting* is by donation - bring your friends!
