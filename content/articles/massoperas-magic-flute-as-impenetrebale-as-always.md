Mozart's _The Magic Flute_ has always been one of Mozart's most curious enigmas for just about everyone, from musicologists to performers. For me as a prospective opera composer, it is a curious double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has some of Mozart's most interesting opera music, particularly since it is right in that era near the end of his life where he truly began to do interesting things musically. But on the other, it has always had a strange relationship with its own plot: the first half of the opera has a very clear direction, but then once it hits the second act the plot comes to a halt, Mozart gets onto the weird Masonic rituals the opera concerns itself with, and then the plot meanders all over the place until almost the very end. It is a very tricky story for opera directors to navigate, even more so in English since it does have spoken dialogue between the numbers.

Enter [MassOpera](/scene/companies/massopera/), which has had plenty of success with reinventing older works with newer scripts or a fresh take on the subject matter. In their production of [_The Magic Flute_](https://massopera.org/events/the-magic-flute/), they have opted to update the spoken script between numbers, with a few libretto tweaks to service these as well. Surprisingly, the results here are a little more mixed than I expected: they opt for a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the dialogue moments, and they also make an attempt to update the setting to, in the words of the program, "an earth ravaged by climate change, inhabited by distracted, busy, device-obsessed humans".

And on the one hand, this adaptation finds a lot of humor in the subject, and at least on this front, I found some of the lines really entertaining taken on their own merits. I also like how it handles Tamino's sudden turn into going along with Sarastro's trials, in that it at least attempts to explain why he might do so instead of just playing it straight and continuing with the story.

But the attempted update by translator and adaptor Kelley Rourke ends up falling flat on its face for a few reasons. For one, apart from the opening in the overture where most of the cast runs around with their faces stuck in phones, you could have left out the program's description of the world and lost absolutely nothing of note. For another, it makes the fatal mistake that most _Magic Flute_ productions make, where it cuts the exchange between Pamina and the Queen of the Night in such a way that the Queen of the Night's motivations remain too ambiguous for the plot to be coherent in any way. 

There are also a few asides that do not feel like they fit, such as Pamina and Papageno having a big aside about nature the first time they meet that feels weird and drags the pacing of the first act down. But ultimately, trying to update the script to contain snarky lines right out of an Aaron Sorkin screenplay undercuts the mystical fairy tale tone that is really the only reason any _Magic Flute_ production ends up working.

The result of all of these things ended up revealing quite a few holes and logic leaps in the plot and characterizations of _Magic Flute_, and it ends up highlighting just how big a mess the plot of _The Magic Flute_ really is. Even when it works, _The Magic Flute_ always has issues with its story just from how weird the plotting is, but this production somehow found a way to amplify the problems already present in the plot, and it is very much a surprise to me considering MassOpera is usually great about updating works in ways that complement the work's strengths rather well.

At the very least, Mozart's score remained unblemished in it all, and I clamored for the moments that the music continued playing. Here, barring a few coordination snarls (including a pretty major one in the Queen of the Night's rage aria where the Queen somehow ended up beating the orchestra to the end of a phrase by one bar twice), the music was generally well-performed by the chamber orchestra occupying the somewhat overcrowded pit at the front.

The cast was also generally up to the task of realizing one of Mozart's more daunting opera scores, although some parts of the cast seemed inexperienced enough that there were a few spotty parts to it all. As Sarastro Jakob Stone's voice came in perhaps a little timid, for instance, but I got the sense there was some inexperience behind that, and he was a good enough actor to sell a role that the adapted script really did not give him much to work with. Ehimemen Omigie also got off to a rather shaky start as Tamino, particularly in his first act aria where a few of his notes felt noticeably under-supported: once he got past this pretty early point, though, Omigie actually grew a little more comfortable in his role, and vocally his singing was much better through the rest. It also helped that his acting skills were very good, and even when the music was not playing he actually crafted an interesting character, which is no small feat considering Tamino usually wanders around _Magic Flute_ as something of a cypher.

Most of the rest of the cast had some very strong points. Joshua Dixon made for an endlessly entertaining Papageno, for instance: he was clearly having far too much fun, and every time he was on stage his antics lit the whole thing on fire. Michael Gonzalez also made for a very good Monostatos: I do think the adapted script did sort of pare down his character's menace perhaps a little too much for Gonzalez to be able to do much with the character, but vocally he had a strong voice and it was quite accurate. But for me, the highlights were Yan Lian as the Queen of the Night and Ruoxi Peng as Pamina. Lian provided an authoritative Queen of the night, and to be able to nail the Queen of the Night at her young age is no small feat, and with as accurate as her voice could be. Peng as Pamina was also a delight: Peng had easily the best voice of the entire night, and she made what can be a fairly punishing part sound easy and crystalline. The cast is rounded out by Xunhao Li, Yunona Tabala, and Chihiro Asano as the three spirits (really, the child soprano roles), all of whom had tight ensemble work, and Tamara Ryan, Kelsey Moisan, and Hailey McAvoy as the three ladies, who brought a great sense of camp to their action.

Ultimately, though, I wish their action had meant more, for in the enigma that is _The Magic Flute_, all this effort can go so far. The adaptation on display here did not necessarily help matters all that much, but _Magic Flute_ is always a strange show to try to put on, and the wrinkles in the piece seemed more present then usual on this night. Still, when Mozart's scores are at their best, it is still a rather good time at the opera, and even despite the bumps in the road along the way I was reasonably entertained.
