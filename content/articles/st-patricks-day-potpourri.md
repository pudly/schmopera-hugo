Happy St. Patrick's Day, everyone! To give an operatic nod to the patron saint of Ireland, here are some appropriately-themed clips via YouTube. First up is Irish tenor [John McCormack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCormack_(tenor)) (1884-1945), who had a pretty enviable career; he sang at Covent Garden, Royal Albert Hall, made tons of recordings. He [apparently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCormack_(tenor)) had such great breath control that he could sing 64 notes in a row of Mozart's "Il mio tesoro" without taking a breath (that's a weird way of putting it, but that's [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCormack_(tenor)) for you). So, here's John McCormack singing "Il mio tesoro".

Irish mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught made [headlines last summe](http://schmopera.com/when-critics-are-jerks/)r during her run as Octavian in _Der Rosenkavalier_ at Glyndebourne, when critics (mostly male) made some pretty awful and unnecessary comments about her physique, and her credibility as a male love interest. Mean critics aside, Tara sounds _fantastic_ in this rendition of "Una voce poco fa" from _Il barbiere di Siviglia_. Big round sound, lots of agility, personality to boot. Enjoy.</p>

For a more vague nod to St. Patrick, here's a clip from Robert Carsen's production of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ by Britten. It's Oberon's fantastic Act I scene, "I know a bank". This clip is not only beautiful, but it's also _particularly_ _green_.

Finally, because sometimes alcohol is involved with St. Paddy's day, I figured a drinking song is in order. Here's a clip from [Otto Schenk's production of _Die Fledermaus_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0260906/), filmed as a TV movie in 1972\. It's pretty hilarious and the cast is stellar; I beg you all, watch until the 2:30 mark, and you won't be sorry. Watch the whole thing [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY2Mw0LMz-E), because it includes a cameo by Schenk as Frosch. Pretty great.

Bonus, because it's beautiful: Aprile Millo singing "Danny Boy."
