In what can be deemed the Great Find of the Weekend, check out [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_performers_at_the_Metropolitan_Opera) of artists who have had the most performers at [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/). I can't vouch for how accurate (or up-to-date) the list is, and since it's a Wikipedia article, go ahead and take it with a grain of salt. That said, have a look at the ten singers with the most Met stage time:

1. [Charles Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Anthony_(tenor), tenor  2928 performances (*what.*) 
2. [George Cehanovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cehanovsky), baritone - 2394 performances 
3. [Angelo Bad√†](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Bad%C3%A0), tenor - 2170 performances 
4. [Paul Franke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Franke), tenor - 1980 performances 
5. [Louis D'Angelo](http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/gisrch2k.r?Term=D%27Angelo,%20Louis%20%5BBaritone%5D&limit=50&vsrchtype=no&xBranch=ALL&xmtype=&Start=&End=&theterm=D%27Angelo,%20Louis%20%5BBaritone%5D&srt=&x=0&xHome=&xHomePath=), baritone - 1882 performances 
6. [James Courtney](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183922/), bass-baritone - 1869 performances 
7. [Andrea Velis](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/obituaries/andrea-velis-67-met-opera-tenor.html), tenor - 1693 performances 
8. [Paul Plishka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Plishka), bass - 1642 performances 
9. [Paolo Ananian](http://forgottenoperasingers.blogspot.ca/2014/06/paolo-ananian-bass.html), bass - 1639 performances 
10. [Giordano Paltrinieri](http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/gisrch2k.r?Term=Paltrinieri,%20Giordano%20%5BTenor%5D&limit=50&vsrchtype=no&xBranch=ALL&xmtype=&Start=&End=&theterm=Paltrinieri,%20Giordano%20%5BTenor%5D&srt=&x=0&xHome=&xHomePath=), tenor - 1618 performances

Although not surprising, it's pretty fascinating that *all* of these singers specialized in comprimario repertoire. Between 1954-2010, Charles Anthony sang with Louis Quilico, Luciano Pavarotti, Renata Scotto, Kiri Te Kanewa, Teresa Stratas, and Jessye Norman; George Cehanovsky sang over 70 roles between 1926-1966, including everything from Sciarrone to Schaunard.

The lives of these people, I can't even imagine it.
