Canadian bass [Robert Pomakov](http://imgartists.com/artist/robert_pomakov) has built himself a pretty enviable career. He's currently in the middle of a Metropolitan Opera-heavy season, returning in January for productions of&nbsp;*Les contes d'Hoffmann*, *Manon* and *Don Carlo*. He has sung for conductors like James Levine, James Conlon, Riccardo Muti,&nbsp;Yannick Nézet-Séguin and Nicola Luisotti.&nbsp;He has been a regular voice at the Canadian Opera Company (*Peter Grimes*, *War and Peace*, *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, *Le rossignol*). He also owns [Opera Bob's Public House](http://www.operabobspublichouse.com) over at 1112 Dundas St. W in Toronto. So I headed over to to his bar to chat with Opera Bob himself about his hard work, that [awesome Vegas-style *Rigoletto*](http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/265786-review-metropolitan-operas-rat-pack-rigoletto-hits-jackpot/), and what he does when he's not onstage.
