This Friday, the Canadian Opera Company's Ensemble Studio have their performance of Così fan tutte, directed by Atom Egoyan. This unique performance features all the young artists in the Ensemble Studio, who work additionally as covers to the mainstage cast. In the last of our three-part series, we meet soprano Claire de Sévigné (Despina) and baritone Gordon Bintner (Don Alfonso). It's a peek into their rehearsal process, and what these two young singers think of their onstage personae.

Please Note, we have been told that there are a few audio issues with the video below. Our sincerest apologies - we are working on resolving it and will be uploading a new version shortly.

The Ensemble Studio performance of Mozart's Così fan tutte is this Friday, February 7th, 7:30pm at the Four Seasons Centre. Tickets can be purchased online here, or by calling 416-363-8231. Looking forward to the performance? Let us know why in the comments below!
