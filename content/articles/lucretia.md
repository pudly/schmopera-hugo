Newly minted Twin Cities opera company [Journey Opera North](/scene/companies/journey-opera-north/) will be presenting Benjamin Britten's _The Rape of Lucretia_ for their inaugural stage production, September 6-8, 2019.

In a preview on Monday, the company showed an impressive cast of young local talent and a very thoughtful premise for the controversial show. The company has also included a violence and intimacy director in the production - a presence that, hopefully, will some day be a regular credit in programs.

As a special note, the company has included an aerial performer into the show, since the [Minnsky Theatre](https://www.minnsky.com/home.html) venue is primarily known for burlesque performances. I am sure it will be an interesting production.
