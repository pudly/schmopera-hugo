Selfishly, I chose to wrap up the year with a list of my favourite tidbits of operatic delight. Included are my favourite renditions of great moments in opera: a bit of Figaro to warm your heart, Kathleen Battle's Zerbinetta, ( in the Met's 1989 _Ariadne auf Naxos,_ which is fascinatingly documented, including footage in rehearsal with _Maestro _Levine), Renée Fleming's shiver-inducing Rusalka and [Hye-Jung Lee](http://www.hyejungleesoprano.com/index.html)'s rockin' Madame Mao. Looking ahead to 2014, two singers I'm excited to see in 2014 at the Canadian Opera Company are Alice Coote and Sir Thomas Allen. So I've also included some of Coote's Nerone at Glyndebourne,  and of course, Sir Thomas Allen's Little List.

Enjoy, and Happy New Year.

## Not _Nozze_: Figaro's Proposal, Against the Grain Theatre-style.

## The way she ends this aria has been giving me shivers for years.

## Merola alum Hye-Jung Lee sang this aria from _Nixon in China_ at the Cardiff finals a few years ago and I think she rocked it.
