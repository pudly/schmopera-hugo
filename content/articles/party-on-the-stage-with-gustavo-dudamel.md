Happy Friday, readers!

This video has made the rounds, both in its full form and in GIF-sized bites, since Gustavo Dudamel gave a New Year's Eve concert with the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra and the Venezuelan Brass Ensemble in Caracas, Venezuela in 2007. 

As a concert-going Canadian with somewhat WASP-ish roots, this rendition of "Mambo" from Bernstein's *West Side Story* looks as fun as it looks disconcerting. I mean, there seems to be so many opportunities for busted instruments, all that flailing around. Still, you can't really argue with the audience's enthusiasm.
