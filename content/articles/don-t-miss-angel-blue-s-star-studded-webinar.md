"What's Next for Opera?" is an excellent question, these days.

Thankfully, Angel Blue and the National Institute of Social Sciences is set to offer some answers, with their webinar on **September 23, 12pm ET**. Blue, the American soprano who this fall heads to The Metropolitan Opera for Terence Blanchard's [_Fire Shut Up in My Bones_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/fire-shut-up-in-my-bones/) and the Gershwins' [_Porgy and Bess_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/porgy-and-bess/), will be joined by four fab panelists.

Star mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, Grammy-nominated countertenor Anthony Roth Constanzo, acclaimed stage director James Robinson (who directs both _Fire_ and _Porgy_ at the Met), and David Lomeli, Santa Fe Opera's Artistic Administrator and Casting Director at the Bayerische Staatsoper — they'll all join Blue for a 90-minute discussion moderated by Opera America CEO Marc Scorca.

On the itinerary: questions about opera's future, its innovations, the safety of live performances, digital opera, and audience queries.

"I immediately wanted to become a part of the National Institute of Social Sciences when I attended their Annual Gold Medal Gala in 2019," says Blue, who is a Trustee of the NISS. "The pandemic has changed society. However, it is organizations like NISS who will be at the forefront of helping our community to remain a strong unit. I'm very honored to be a National Institute Trustee, and I hope that everyone will enjoy the webinar 'What's Next in Opera?'"
