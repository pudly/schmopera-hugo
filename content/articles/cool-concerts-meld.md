*The Times* called it "an avant-garde happening that left one speechless with its epic zaniness," and now viewers around the world can see for themselves the curiosity that's inherent in [*MELD*](https://vimeo.com/171614403). Captured by [The Space](https://www.thespace.org/), the filmed concert is the brianchild of composer Benedict Mason and director of photography Andreas Schimanski. *MELD* was commissioned for the 2014 BBC Proms, and was performed in London's Royal Albert Hall with the [Aurora Orchestra](/aurora-orchestra-fun-frankenstein/) and [Chantage](http://www.chantage.org/) choir. The piece is part of Mason's "Music for Concert Halls" series, and *MELD* explores a novel use of traditional spaces and the integration of the audience into the performance itself.

With multiple cameras placed around Royal Albert Hall, The Space has captured a concert experience where "the end result places the audience at the heart of the experience, giving a vivid sense of the movements and interactions	of the musicians and singers	with the space."

In a word, it's mesmerising. And we certainly wish we were there!
