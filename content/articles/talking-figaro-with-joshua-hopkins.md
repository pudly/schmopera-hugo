Canadian baritone [Joshua Hopkins](http://joshuahopkins.com/) is in Toronto to sing the title role in the Canadian Opera Company's *The Barber of Seville*. He was totally friendly and fun to talk with, even though I made him come in early for rehearsal. Joshua chats about Figaro, singing Rossini, and what it's like to sing with family in the audience. 

*The Barber of Seville* opens April 17th at the Four Seasons Centre. For details and tickets, [click here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville.aspx).
