short_description: If you’re not following Joyce DiDonato’s YouTube Channel (the Yankee
  Diva), you should change that. I found this adorable video Joyce made while touring
  Handel’s Alcina with the English Concert Orchestra. Joyce enjoys (and gets lost)
  along with opera favourites Alice Coote, Anna Christy, Ben Johnson, and the charming
  Harry Bicket. So, check this one out, and then catch up on your Yankee Diva.
