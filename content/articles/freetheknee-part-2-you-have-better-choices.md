[Opera Diva Dress Collection](https://web.facebook.com/groups/456489367792116/) and [Sing For Hope](http://www.singforhope.org/) teamed up for a special photoshoot to promote and celebrate the passionate, fashionable, entrepreneurial, and altruistic divas that make up ODDC, and showcase the 2016 Sing For Hope Pianos as the first joint project under our cultural partnership. 

For the shoot, hairstylist and makeup artist extraordinaire, Olivia McKeldin of [Bombshell Studios NYC](http://www.bombshellstudiosnyc.com/) was on hand to help us enhance the natural beauty of our gorgeous volunteer opera diva models! During the day and into the evening cocktail party hosted by our cultural partner, we got to admire and say goodbye to the 2016 pianos before they head off to their new homes in schools throughout New York City, and pay homage to each of the singer's individual styles. 

If you are in NYC this week, you'll see fashionistas strutting their stuff throughout this concrete jungle for New York Fashion Week. Why not take inspiration from these fearless fashionistas and bend (or do away) with some of the [conventional "rules" for audition dress](/a-letter-to-the-modern-diva/) that have been ingrained in us since our collegiate days? We've been so moved by the personal stories of our members and the supportive nature of our not so little singing sisterhood these past few weeks. ODDC member Bryn synthesized the key points of our discussion into this [powerful blog post](http://www.brynjimenez.com/single-post/2016/09/06/The-Word-Cloud-of-Body-Shame).

Rather than recap, we decided to use our photoshoot to create a "lookbook" to serve as inspiration to empower the operatic community to make choices that serve your artistry.

Liana arrived to the ODDC/Sing For Hope shoot wearing this adorable dress. We didn't have to do much to style this one, as the silhouette speaks for itself.

</figure>

Sara loves Stop Staring for their comfortably constructed, seductively flattering, vintage inspired looks. When Sharin walked in, we knew we had just the dress for her. This dress is perfect for any femme fatale from Carmen, to Zerlina, to Musetta, and all the sassy ladies of opera in between.

We love this look for its effortless mix of operatic glamour and modern style. This new mommy diva came to Suzanne to rent a dress, and left with this fabulous jacket for an upcoming concert. She paired it with a textured pant and open-toe red pumps to make the outfit really pop. This look would not only work for an audition, but would be perfect for a daytime recital of some newer, edgier works.

We really thank you all for getting behind #FreeTheKnee and hope that we've converted others with this post. As you can see, we aren't saying anything radical or telling you to dress like you are going out to the club, we are simply encouraging you to dress for your  own unique body and style. 

After the Sing For Hope cocktail party, our friend and ODDC enthusiast (AKA Sharin's husband Ryan MacPherson) put it perfectly when we were talking about some of the recent threads on ODDC. We all agreed that there is never anything wrong with our bodies, but certain outfits are just better than others when it comes to dressing our unique selves. To quote a very wise husband, "You look amazing, but I think you have better choices!" 

With Vibrato, Legato and Love
