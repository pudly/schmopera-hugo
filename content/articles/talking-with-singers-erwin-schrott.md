preamble: |-
  Uruguayan bass-baritone Erwin Schrott is gearing up to get devilish: he's set to sing the role of Méphistophélès in Gounod's _Faust_, opposite Diana Damrau as Marguerite and Michael Fabiano in the title role. The production by David McVicar runs 11 April to 6 May, including a live cinema broadcast on 30 April.

  Like most bass-baritones, Schrott is accustomed to playing villains - devils, womanizers, and entitled Counts - and he enthusiastically unpacks the character of Méphistophélès in our great chat.

### Why do you sing professionally?

Singing makes me happy and I am honoured to do what I love to do. The first time that I stepped on a stage at the very early age, I somehow knew that I wanted to play music, sing and perform every day - if possible. My heart and soul are grateful and thankful for what I do and I will not like to change my job for anything in the whole world.

### What do you know now about the singing career that you wish you knew 20 years ago?

I believe that we are not supposed to know many things at the beginning, but to learn while exploring, learning and learning from our own mistakes. There are definitely a couple of episodes or situations that I will not like to repeat, but all in all I'm happy with the experience so far.

>So, I think that in the end, if I had the chance to get in contact with the younger me, I would just whisper "keep being patient".

I knew that I needed to be patient, and I have been very patient since the beginning of my career. I'm blessed to have very good friends and fans that help me, with their love, to keep me strong even at times where things were not easy.

If I had the chance to travel in time and get together with the younger me 20 years ago, I would definitely give myself very good advice about things that are not career-related, but that concern life. Probably I would tell the younger me to stay away from some people and to get closer to some others.

So, I think that in the end, if I had the chance to get in contact with the younger me, I would just whisper "keep being patient".

### What kind of character is Méphistophélès in Gounod's _Faust_? What do you think are some common misconceptions about his character?

He is not the antithesis of god, he is god himself, the other half. He is that figure that was created to keep us under control through fear. He is much more human than the evil spirit that everyone like to fantasise with. He understands human nature and thats why he knows well what people are craving.

> I see Méphistophélès as an elegant and fun character, a master that knows humanity much better than its creator.

I think that he even understands love, but he just finds it overrated. It is through humanity's desires and wishes that he finds a gap in all what the creator has supremely given to humanity. He reminds all of us how unfair life is and that it is difficult to let go of the most precious thing that we have. He reminds us of how short life is and how lonely it is to have to die while outside of our window there is a party called life that for some of us it is just starting and for some others it is about to end.

That's the exact moment when he appears, when we feel left alone and short of answers, or at a time where we start to redefine certain aspects or beliefs about life. Let's face it: if we had the chance to clone ourselves in a younger self and keep our memories or our soul…I wonder how many of us will take the chance immediately.

Well, Méphistophélès is that crazy genius that has the power to give you a second chance in exchange of a little souvenir...your soul. I see Méphistophélès as an elegant and fun character, a master that knows humanity much better than its creator.

Without any doubt he doesn't come to earth, he lives on the earth already where he amuses himself challenging a power as strong as his. A character that goes against everything that we have been taught through religion, society and morals. He is created to keep a dynamic order for a wild nature of humans.

### What do you find are the unique joys and challenges of playing villains?

The joy is about humanity, the dark and bright side of it. We find the most beautiful moments in opera, when the hero is challenged by situations that are not pleasurable and the hero needs to endure to live up to those challenges. Those situations are generally being created because of the evil imagination of a villain, and we get to enjoy the most beautiful music that comes together with the most unbearable pain or suffering of the character.

We need the villains; because of them we have the most beautiful moments in opera. And even when the villain is not the title role it will end up having the audience acclaim, because they all have the tendency to sympathize with the devil.

> There are no challenges in playing villains, because creating a character is an easy task.

Jokes aside, I see the villains and all the characters like the many layers of a whole. Every character in the opera is part of a whole being that represents the beauty of humanity in a more detailed way than when we are simply labelled as good or bad, black or white. We are all of it, we have it all in us, we are part of the whole and opera usually does good work of reminding us.

There are no challenges in playing villains, because creating a character is an easy task. It is enough to see people trashing others for their own favour, public image or even for marketing purposes: that's a true villain and we can for sure study them to make exceptional characters for any freak show.

### If you didn't sing for a living, what do you think you would do instead?

Well, I will conquer the world and open an "Outlet for Souls" somewhere. :-)
