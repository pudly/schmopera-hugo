## What do you like about the story of *Il matrimonio segreto*?

**Max Hoehn**: It's a piece that revels in anarchy. The story is driven by this collision of eccentric and forceful personalities who are trapped in the ultimate engagement party from hell. The ensembles are a real high point because they're this rather mad combination of brilliantly crafted music and wild, chaotic situations. 

## What does it take to put together a production that tours well?

**Hoehn**: You need a strong structure for each scene and each character needs a clear identity form the outset. Within that structure there needs to be flexibility for the peculiarities of each venue and the ability for the singers to improvise, which is what makes this style of performing potentially so special.

## What does it mean to you to challenge the way opera is traditionally performed?

**Hoehn**: I don't believe there is a "traditional" way of performing opera whatever the context. However, what is interesting is taking the opera out and about to farms, castles, studios and churches and bringing the audience very close to the voices. *Opera buffa* was and is a popular form, so Pop-Up Opera's mission can tap into that spirit.
