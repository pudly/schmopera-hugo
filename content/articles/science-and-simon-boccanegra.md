I love opera, and so does Stephen Fry. I've [written](/stephen-frys-latest-charming-appearance-at-the-royal-opera-house/) about this gem before, but it's worth revisiting. Stephen Fry did a special with the Royal Opera House, called _The Science of Opera_, where he went to see _Simon Boccanegra_ with British comedian [Alan Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davies). A team of scientists were on hand to measure their emotional experience throughout the opera. They measured their heart rates and how much they sweat; they even asked Stephen and Alan to press buttons when they were feeling an emotionally climactic moment in the opera. Stephen is a seasoned opera lover, but Alan was a first-timer; it's really fascinating to see what's in common between their experiences of the same thing. There are even appearances by Antonio Pappano and the fab Joyce DiDonato. Great watching for a Sunday afternoon. Enjoy!
