Next month with the [Kingston Road United Church Concert Series](https://www.kruc.ca/concerts/), you can see something that might truly be a once-in-a-lifetime event.

On **October 5, 7:30pm**, acclaimed countertenor Daniel Taylor is joined in concert by four fellow countertenors, CÃ©sar Aguilar, Ian Sabourin, Benjamin Shaw, and Ryan McDonald. That's five (five!) countertenors on one stage - a rare moment in operatic history if there ever was one. 

The concert - aptly titled *Countertenor Madness!* - is likely to be a crash course in what makes the countertenor one of opera's most exciting voice types. 

Tickets are just $25, and Schmopera readers are in luck: the first 10 people to reserve by phone (416-699-6091) can get two tickets for the price of one, payable in cash at the door. Just be sure to mention the magic word when you call: "Schmopera!"

Details about *Countertenor Madness!* are [available here](https://countertenors.eventbrite.com). For the full line-up of the Kingston Road United Church Concert Series, [click here.](https://www.kruc.ca/concerts/)
