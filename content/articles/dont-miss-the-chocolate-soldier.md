short_description: If the central love story doesn&#039;t entice you, go for the brilliant
  performances in the supporting cast. Mezzo-soprano Eugenia Dermentzis is a scene-stealer
  as Aurelia, her face an exaggerated picture of uppity, bewildered, and scheming;
  even with her polished mezzo, her presence onstage is something delightfully out
  of a Pixar film. Plus, The Chocolate Soldier is a beautiful chance to catch Schmopera&#039;s
  own Gregory Finney onstage as the patriarch Popoff.

Running until **April 30**, Oscar Straus' [*The Chocolate Soldier*](http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html) is the latest offering of beautiful tunes and charming humour from [Toronto Operetta Theatre](/scene/companies/toronto-operetta-theatre/). With lots of soul from the pit, Peter Tiefenbach leads singers and orchestra through the operetta based on the play by George Bernard Shaw, with a score full of next-door exoticism befitting of a tale set in 19th-century Bulgaria.

We were lucky to catch the final dress rehearsal of *The Chocolate Soldier*, a piece new to us, and cast with strong Canadian singers. [Michael Nyby](/scene/people/michael-nyby/) is a strapping Bumerli, the Swiss soldier who unapologetically finds safety in an enemy home (strictly speaking); his wry smile and cavalier stride across the stage work beautifully with his healthy baritone, which extends impressively up into tenor-dom. [Jennifer Taverner](/scene/people/jennifer-taverner/) is a sweet Nadina Popoff, the Bulgarian girl who covers for Bumerli, making adorable attempts at holding her own next to the bold Swiss visitor. Her sound is warm, even na√Øve, and to catch her in a lead role seems an overdue treat.

If the central love story doesn't entice you, go for the brilliant performances in the supporting cast. Mezzo-soprano Eugenia Dermentzis is a scene-stealer as Aurelia, her face an exaggerated picture of uppity, bewildered, and scheming; even with her polished mezzo, her presence onstage is something delightfully out of a Pixar film. Plus, *The Chocolate Soldier* is a beautiful chance to catch Schmopera's own [Gregory Finney](/authors/greg/) onstage as the patriarch Popoff. In a handful of magnetic scenes, Finney manages to secure himself a catchphrase, some catchy tunes, and a hilarious air of and elderly gentleman who lovingly blusters and bumbles.

Go for the melodies, the comedy, and the standout performances by some of Canada's most exciting talent.

>*The Chocolate Soldier*, directed by Toronto Operetta Theatre's Guillermo Silva-Marin, runs at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts until **April 30, 2017**. For ticket information, [click right here.](http://www.torontooperetta.com/tickets.html)
