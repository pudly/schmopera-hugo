## Neil Crory Tribute Concert

On **October 11, 7pm** at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre, a formidable group of Canadian artists [pays homage to the late Neil Crory](https://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/events/neil-crory-tribute-concert) - producer, impresario, and mentor. Speakers and performers include Ben Heppner, Isabel Bayrakdarian, Isaiah Bell, Benjamin Butterfield, Tracy Dahl, Nathalie Paulin, Brett Polegato, Jean Stilwell, Krisztina Szabó, Erin Wall, Monica Whicher, and members of the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra.

## Odyssey Opera

Continuing its Tudors-themed 2019-20 season, Boston-based [Odyssey Opera](/scene/companies/odyssey-opera/) presents Giovanni Pacini's [_Maria, Regina d'Inghilterra_](https://www.odysseyopera.org/2019-pacini-maria-regina-d-inghilterra/), **Nov. 1-3**. The 1842 opera tells the story of unrequited love between Queen Mary I, Scottish adventurer Riccardo Fenimoor, and Clotilde, and features two major soprano roles; Amy Shoremount-Obra takes on Mary, opposite Alisa Jordheim as Clotilde.

Pacini, a missing link of sorts among 19th-century Italian composers, wrote over 70 operas. "A performance of Pacini's Maria is extraordinary!" says Gil Rose, Odyssey Opera's Artistic and General Director. "We hope audiences will join Odyssey in rediscovering both this forgotten composer, and his wrongfully neglected masterpiece."

This fully staged production of [_Maria, Regina d'Inghilterra_](https://www.bostontheatrescene.com/season/maria-regina-dInghilterra/) runs November 1 and 3.
