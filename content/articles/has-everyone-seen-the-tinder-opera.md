If you've not yet seen *Connection Lost (The Tinder Opera)*, you should probably stop what you're doing and watch it now.

Seriously, it's our current obsession. Written and directed by Adam Taylor, with music brilliantly composed by tenor [Scott Joiner](/scene/people/scott-joiner/), *Connection Lost* isn't just funny "for an opera", it's goddamn hilarious, period.

Brian Morales conducts a chamber ensemble and a host of opera singing Tinder dates, as one man's quest for romantic connection takes him through a lot of swiping left, and a charming amount of hopeful right-swiping.

Bravo, team, on what we hope is the first of many projects like this.
