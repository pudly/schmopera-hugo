This past month has been a delightful change of pace for the people at Schmopera. I write you all from the incomparably beautiful Banff Centre in Banff, AB, where I'm joining Against the Grain Theatre and the Canadian Opera Company in a new workshop of the new opera by Canadians James Rolfe and Anna Chatterton, *Crush*. AtG's Artistic Director Joel Ivany is also putting up *A Little Too Cozy*, based on Mozart's *Così fan tutte*, marking the third in his trilogy of "transladaptations" of the three Mozart/Da Ponte operas.

I'm also thrilled to have introduced several new guest contributors, and we've been able to share posts by fellow arts bloggers who have valuable things to say. Here's a quick list of pieces by new writers that are absolutely worth checking out:

- Blanch Israël's [The Future of Opera is Indie](http://www.schmopera.com/the-future-of-opera-is-indie/)
- Gianmarco Segato's [Opera on Steroids: Budapest!](http://www.schmopera.com/opera-on-steroids-budapest/)
- Patrick Hansen's [And I Know Things Now](http://www.schmopera.com/and-i-know-things-now/)
- Edward Atkinson's [Musician's Marketing Masterclass](http://www.schmopera.com/musician-marketing-masterclass/)
- Kristen Seikaly's [6 Creative Ways to Learn a Language (Affordably)](http://www.schmopera.com/6-creative-ways-to-learn-a-language-affordably/)

Finally, we've begun "Spotlight on...", a brand new series of interviews, featuring young artists across Canada and the United States. I love talking with young artists, because they're thoughtful and driven, and they tend to surprise me with their responses to what I consider classic questions for artists.

So, here are a few pieces I feel particularly attached to from our June archives. If you like them too, please share them on your social media outlet of choice; just be sure to find us, at [/schmopera](https://www.facebook.com/schmopera) or [@Schmopera](https://twitter.com/schmopera).
