So, I have a loving husband who happens to be a *Star Trek* fan. There's not a whole lot of direct overlap between a sci-fi lover and an opera lover, but one point of contact is in Robert Picardo, (aka The Doctor), and his singing skills on *Star Trek: Voyager*.

One more gem: the Doctor sings a duet ("Dio, che nell'alma infondere" from _Don Carlo_, no less) with a miniature holographic version of himself. It's dubbed, instead of Robert Picardo's real voice, but you won't care.

And finally, for way more _Star Trek _than you ever thought could fit in an opera, here's _The Abduction of the Seraglio (A Star Trek Themed Opera)_, presented by [Southern Illinois Music Festival](http://www.sifest.com/) earlier this year.
