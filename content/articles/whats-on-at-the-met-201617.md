Well, [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/people/metropolitan-opera/) has announced its [season line-up for 2016/17](http://www.metopera.org/Season/2016-17-Season/), and for the most part, the repertoire seems, to use an -ism from a [fellow blogger](https://operaramblings.wordpress.com/), quite the "steak dinner".

There are a few exciting surprises, though. First and foremost, Kaija Saariaho's [*L'amour de loin*](http://www.metopera.org/Season/2016-17-Season/amour-de-loin-saariaho-tickets/) will hit the stage in December 2016, marking the Met's first opera by a woman since 1903. Delightfully, maestra [Susanna Mälkki](/scene/people/susanna-malkki/) makes her Met debut on the podium for this new production by Robert Lepage. The casting is interesting to me; [Eric Owens](/scene/people/eric-owens/) is Jaufé Rudel, [Susanna Phillips](/scene/people/susanna-phillips/) is Clémence, and [Tamara Mumford](/scene/people/tamara-mumford/) is Pélérin (The Pilgrim). Owens and Phillips aren't known for their contemporary work, but my curiosity is officially piqued.

With the rest of the season playing it safe (the Met's standby productions of *La bohème*, *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, Vegas *Rigoletto* and *The Magic Flute* all make a comeback), at least there are some exciting artists getting stage time. South African soprano [Pretty Yende](/scene/people/pretty-yende/) sings Rosina in *Barbiere* and performances of Juliette in *Roméo et Juliette*, [Gerald Finley](/scene/people/gerald-finley/) takes the title role in *Guillaume Tell*, and [Alice Coote](/scene/people/alice-coote/) will sing Idamante in *Idomeneo*. A bit of a surprise is [Plácido Domingo](/scene/people/placido-domingo/), who not only conducts *Don Giovanni*, but sings a few performances of Giorgio Germont in *La traviata* ([we've written about this whole deal before](/placido-baritones-ripple/)).

Plus, Canadians will get excited about [Adrianne Pieczonka](/scene/people/adrianne-pieczonka/)'s Leonore in *Fidelio*, and COC Music Director [Johannes Debus](/scene/people/johannes-debus/) conducting [*Salome*](http://www.metopera.org/Season/2016-17-Season/salome-strauss-tickets/).

Veteran Met performers like [Dmitri Hvorostovsky](/scene/people/dmitri-hvorostovsky/), [Patricia Racette](/scene/people/patricia-racette/), Rolando Villazón, Simon Keenlyside, [Michael Fabiano](/scene/people/michael-fabiano/), [Isabel Leonard](/scene/people/isabel-leonard/), and maestro [Plácido Domingo](/scene/people/placido-domingo/) are popping up all over the season, reprising signature roles (like [Mariusz Kwiecień](/scene/people/mariusz-kwiecien/) in *Don Giovanni* and [Renée Fleming](/scene/people/renee-fleming/) in *Der Rosenkavalier*) and new steps forward (like [Diana Damrau](/scene/people/diana-damrau/) in *Roméo et Juliette*).

The 2015/16 season left me with a similar feeling of being let down by the Met. To be fair, they're at once a giant opera company *and* a tourist attraction, so the exhaustive repeats of some productions are understandable if they consistently attract audiences.

Saariaho's *L'amour de loin* is an exciting step for the Met; it's a bit disappointing though, that the runners-up for contemporary opera are Alfano's *Cyrano de Bergerac* and Strauss' *Der Rosenkavalier*.
