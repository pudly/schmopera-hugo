Hungarian-Canadian mezzo-soprano [Krisztina Szabó](http://www.krisztinaszabo.com/) is no strangers to the Four Seasons Centre stage. This time, she'll sing The Woman in Schoenberg's *Erwartung*, which, with Bartók's *Bluebeard's Castle*, makes up the [iconic double-bill by Robert Lepage](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BluebeardErwartung.aspx). 

This is the fourth revival at the COC for Lepage's *Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung* since its premiere in 1993, and the first performance in the Four Seasons Centre. I asked Krisztina about *Erwartung*, what it means, and what it's like to sing one of the darkest one-woman-shows in the repertoire.

*Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung* runs at the COC from May 6-23. Follow the links below for more details and to purchase tickets. You *do not* want to miss this production.
