Here we continue with the \"Smugglers’ Quintet\" from Bizet’s opera Carmen."

While you may not personally have smuggled anything important in your life to be able to draw from your own experiences for this fun-filled excerpt, there is an inbuilt feeling of illicit excitement that runs throughout, and a wonderful sense of camaraderie between the characters that is developed. If I had to choose to spend an evening with this group or the dour maids of _Elektra_, I know which one I'd choose.

One of the strengths of the set excerpts is that they do test the three main operatic languages, and this scene from _Carmen_ is the perfect way to show off your acquaintance with the language of love. As with all the excerpts, it is crucial to show that your pronunciation is as close to perfect as it can be. We all have at least one language that is weaker than the others, and for me it's French. I found that by the end of the process of learning, reading the text to a friend who was a native speaker wasn't enough; I had to sing it to them for them while playing in order for them to really judge me well. I then found that luckily, since the scene is fast, it was easier to be criticised less harshly when I sang and played together, than when I simply read the text alone!
