<p>
	As Artistic Director of Tapestry Opera, Michael Mori is a leading figure in the creation of new Canadian opera. Tapestry Opera just celebrated 35 years of commissioning new works and bringing together composers, librettists, and singers; a quick glance at their <a href="https://tapestryopera.com/category/shows/current/" target="_blank">upcoming shows</a> make it clear that it's really been 35 years and counting. Among the Artistic Directors of North America's opera companies, it's fair to say that Michael Mori has a unique vantage point on the industry of opera and its future. I ask him about what Tapestry does, and why historical works don't always mean cultural relevance.
