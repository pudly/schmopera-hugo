On October 22, Edmonton Opera launches what it describes as an “electric and exciting” 2022-23 season with one of Giacomo Puccini’s well-known dramas: _Tosca_.

“Grand opera is back,” says Joel Ivany, Artistic Director of Edmonton Opera. “We’re not just trying to do it, we will do it. It’s important to remind our core patrons that these big operas mean a lot to a certain group of people. And for those who don’t know these big operas, this is a wonderful introduction to what this multicultural artform is. These productions are put on all around the world and you can see them in Edmonton, as well.”

A pair of Newfoundland-born singers - tenor [David Pomeroy](/scene/people/david-pomeroy/) and baritone [Peter Barrett](/scene/people/peter-barrett/) - headline the cast as the painter Mario Cavaradossi and Baron Scarpia, respectively. Barrett, last seen by Edmonton Opera audiences as Marcello in the February 2022 production of Puccini’s _La bohème_, is celebrating a role debut as the diabolical chief of police.

"I floated the role by Peter and he asked to sing through parts of it to see how it felt," explains Ivany. "He absolutely rocked it as Marcello last season in Bohème and this is a wonderful chance to see how he approaches another fantastic role to his repertoire."

Singing the role of Floria Tosca is American soprano Karen Slack in her company debut. "Tosca is one of those iconic roles that when you get into opera you dream of being able to sing one day," says Slack. "It's a dream role for me."

"I've known Karen for years and years and years and she's such an advocate for the equality we desire to seek in this industry," says Ivany. "Having her as Tosca, interacting with the cast, demonstrates that she is an artist that has something to say, is an important voice, and we want to introduce her to our company and to the city. On top of all that, she sings amazingly."

Edmonton Opera's production of Puccini's _Tosca_, conducted by Simon Rivard and directed by Alison Moritz, will be performed at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium on October 22, 25 and 28. It will be performed in Italian with English subtitles.
