## *Der Rosenkavalier*

Now, our much-needed holiday visits to Canada meant that we missed the December 20th opening night of *Der Rosenkavalier* at the [Royal Opera House](/scene/companies/royal-opera-house/), but that's ok. We're still thrilled to have the chance to see Robert Carsen's new production of Strauss' stunning opera, and to hear the likes of Sophie Bevan and [Alice Coote](/talking-with-singers-alice-coote/) in their elements. And of course, [Renée Fleming](/scene/people/renee-fleming/)'s performances of the Marschallin are the last of her operatic career; it's no surprise that the run is nearly sold out. A few tickets remain for the **January 17th and January 24th** performances, so [click here](http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/der-rosenkavalier-by-robert-carsen) for details.

## *Written on Skin*

Oddly enough, we've now heard two in-concert performances of George Benjamin's entrancing 2012 opera, with the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/in-review-written-on-skin/) and the [Mahler Chamber Orchestra](/still-stunning-written-on-skin/). For the revival of Katie Mitchell's production at the Royal Opera House, soprano [Barbara Hannigan](/scene/people/barbara-hannigan/) and baritone [Christopher Purves](/talking-with-singers-christopher-purves/) return to their roles of Agnès and The Protector; countertenor Iestyn Davies sings the role of The Boy. Five performances run between **13-30 January**; for details and tickets, [click here.](http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/written-on-skin-by-katie-mitchell)

## *The Depraved Appetite of Tarrare The Freak*

Great title, right? Wattle & Daub Figure Theatre presents Tom and Tobi Poster's "monstrous chamber opera for puppets" at Wilton's Music Hall, **January 30 to February 18**. The chamber opera is based on the true story of Tarrare the Freak, the 18th-century French spy with a penchant for snakes, cats, and amputated limbs. The more we read about *Tarrare the Freak*, the more questions arise. Curious? [Click here](http://www.wattleanddaub.co.uk/tarrare.html) for details.

## *Mozart vs. Machine*

On **February 3** at the Folkestone Quarterhouse, [Mahogany Opera Group](/scene/companies/mahogany-opera-group/) presents the world premiere of *Mozart vs. Machine*, a combo of Mozart, electronic music, and video projection. Mahogany sums it up better than we ever could: "Alone in his Manhattan research laboratory, Raymond Scott, the father of electronic music, is developing a machine to generate random musical patterns. When one of his devices accidentally tears a hole in the universe it distorts time and brings him face to face with classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."
