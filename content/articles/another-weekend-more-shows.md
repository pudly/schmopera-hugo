Tonight (it's quasi-weekend) I'm going to [Koerner Hall](https://www.facebook.com/koernerhall) to hear [Isabel Bayrakdarian sing with Tafelmusik](http://www.tafelmusik.org/). The programme is titled _Rival Queens_, and I'm pretty excited about it. It's inspired by that [famous 18th-century operatic feud](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whine-women-and-song-the-bitter-rivalry-of-handels-divas-816644.html) between superstars [Faustina Bordoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faustina_Bordoni) and [Francesca Cuzzoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Cuzzoni).

Isabel will sing arias by Handel, etc., that Faustina made famous, and arias (also by Handel, etc.) that were written specifically for Francesca. "a catfight on stage isn't that far-fetched after all." Isabel Bayrakdarian: One woman embodies _two divas_. This should be fun. _Rival Queens_ has performances until Sunday, April 13th; for ticket info, click [here](http://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/rival-queens-isabel-bayrakdarian).

And on Friday night, I'm going to the opera. [Fawn Opera & New Music](http://www.fawnopera.com/) is presenting a preview of their next new piece, currently in development; it's called [_L'homme et le ciel_](http://www.fawnopera.com/event/homme-et-le-ciel/), with music by [Adam Scime](http://www.adamscime.com/) and libretto by [Ian Koiter](http://www.fawnopera.com/). The preview will features singers Giovanni Spanu, [Adanya Dunn](http://www.fawnopera.com/collaborating-artists/production-team/), and [Larissa Koniuk](http://bicycleopera.com/artists/co-founders/) (of [Bicycle Opera](http://bicycleopera.com/)), and the [Thin Edge New Music Collective](http://www.thethinedgenewmusiccollective.com/). [Brady Bothwell](http://bradybothwell.com/)'s multi-media set incorporates responsive digital art, something that sounds intriguing indeed. It's conducted by [Patrick Murray](http://patrickmurraymusic.net/) and directed by [Amanda Smith](http://www.fawnopera.com/collaborating-artists/production-team/), and it's all happening at the Ernest Balmer Studio (home of [Tapestry New Opera Works](http://www.tapestryopera.com/)) Friday at 8pm. It's PYWC, with donations going towards creating new Canadian music and opera.
