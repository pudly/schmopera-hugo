  This spring, opera-going Canadians are in luck: across the country, opera is a-happening.

  Starting in the West, you can still catch Verdi&#039;s Don Carlo at Vancouver Opera, playing until May 11th. The cast includes Canadian faves like Joni Henson and Brett Polegato, and they&#039;re doing it in Italian. Nice.

This spring, opera-going Canadians are in luck: across the country, opera is a-happening.

Starting in the West, you can still catch Verdi's _Don Carlo_ at [Vancouver Opera](https://www.vancouveropera.ca/Carlo-2013-14.html), playing until May 11th. The cast includes Canadian faves like Joni Henson and Brett Polegato, _and_ they're doing it in Italian. Nice. 

In Calgary, [Cowtown Opera](http://www.cowtownoperacompany.com/2013/06/12/barber-of-cowtown/#more-1867) is presenting its very own _Barber of Cowtown_, from May 29th-June1st. It's Rossini's _Il barbiere di Siviglia, _in English, "Cowtown Style". To top it off, our famed [Christopher Mayell](/two-tenors-youtube-comments/) is singing Count Almaviva.
On the Prairies, [Saskatoon Opera](http://www.saskatoonopera.ca/#season) presents Mozart's _The Magic Flute, _opening June 12th. It's conducted by [Christopher Mokrzewski](http://www.christophermokrzewski.com/Home/Christopher_Mokrzewski.html), Resident Conductor at [Calgary Opera](http://www.calgaryopera.com/) and Music Director of [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), and it features a jackpot cast of Canadian talent. Included are COC Ensemble Studio alumni [Chris Enns](http://barczablog.com/2013/01/25/10forenns/) (Tamino), [Neil Craighead](http://neilcraighead.wordpress.com/) (Sarastro), [Gordon Bintner](http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/) (Papageno) and [Ambur Braid](http://amburbraid.com/) (Queen of the Night). [Tickets](http://www.saskatoonopera.ca/#season).

In Québec, you'll have your pick of great Italian operas. [L'Opéra de Montréal](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/shows/2013-2014-season/turandot) is putting up _Turandot_, opening June 17th, starring Japanese soprano [Hiromi Omura](http://www.hiromiomura.com/) in the title role. At [L'Opéra de Québec](http://www.operadequebec.qc.ca/francais/macbeth.htm), you can see Canadian baritone Gregory Dahl sing the title role in Verdi's _Macbeth_, also opening June 17th.

Finally, here in Toronto, there are the usual good opera pickings. Opening tomorrow, the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx) presents Massenet's _Don Quichotte_. Bass (and legend) [Ferruccio Furlanetto](http://www.ferrucciofurlanetto.com/) stars in the title role, and baritone [Quinn Kelsey](http://schmopera.com/talking-with-singers-quinn-kelsey/) will sing the role of Sancho, Quichotte's faithful servant. It plays May 9-24th at the Four Seasons Centre, and I can't wait to see it. [Tickets!](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx)

In June, [Tapestry](https://tapestryopera.com/) presents _Shelter_, a contemporary opera by [Juliet Palmer](http://www.torontoartsfoundation.org/First-Impressions-hidden-pages/Juliet-Palmer), with a libretto by Julie Salverson. With a cast of essential Tapestry talent, (like Keith Klassen and Andrea Ludwig) _Shelter_ plays at the Berkeley Street Theatre from June 12-15th; it's a show I will truly regret not being in town to see. Later in June, [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/pelleas) puts up Debussy's spectacular _P[elléas et Mélisande](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/pelleas)_. Étienne Dupuis and Miriam Khalil sing the title role in this production by Joel Ivany and Julien LeBlanc, which will be performed outdoors in the COC's Max Tanenbaum Courtyard Gardens. _Pelléas_ plays from June 19-25th, and it's [not to be missed](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/pelleas).

I'm sure there's plenty I've left out of my little summary. Feel free to chime in using the comments below!
