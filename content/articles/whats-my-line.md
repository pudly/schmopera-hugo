preamble: |-
  Here at The Banff Centre, we're nearing the halfway point of Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century. Two productions are underway: *A Little Too Cozy*, reminiscent of Mozart's *CosÃ¬ fan tutte* with a new libretto by [Joel Ivany](/scene/people/joel-ivany/), and *Crush*, [James Rolfe](/scene/people/james-rolfe/) and [Anna Chatterton](/scene/people/anna-chatterton/)'s new opera based on *Don Giovanni*. Revisiting old stories with the lens of society today is the common theme between these two operas, and so it's been a true summer of exploring words.

  I asked the casts of *A Little Too Cozy* and *Crush* to send me their favourite lines from their respective operas. Read on, and get curious about these shows. Bonus points if you can identify which bits are Ivany, and which are Chatterton.

"Love them for muscles and screaming our names, tell them they're great and they'll do it again." 

"Bite my heart, drink my small life." 

"I'd rather burn my nuts right off!" 

"Pedal to the metal, taximan." 

"My Dora the explorer..." 

"You're no woman, you're a *lesbian*." 

"What the hell? You two are married? To two sexy, hunky fellows!" 

"I'm warning you, SHUT UP!"

"At last, I have a gorgeous man in my arms...and I can't even get him up."

"Put your tail between your thin pins!" 

"Pull up your pants, you traitor!" 

"I might be bisexual."

> *Crush* opens on July 17th (14+), and *A Little Too Cozy* opens July 26th, both at the Banff Centre, Banff, AB. For details and tickets, follow the Box Office links below.
