[Whitney Houston's hologram](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34249920) will sing a concert next year at "a major U.S. venue" next year. Pat Houston, president of the Whitney Houston Estate and Greek billionaire Alki David, CEO of Hologram USA, are working together on this latest hologram concert venture; Whitney's image will be shown onstage "the same way that Tupac and Snoop Dogg interacted onstage at Coachella," according to David.

Yes, [this isn't the first](http://mic.com/articles/89785/how-creepy-holographic-concerts-are-transforming-the-future-of-the-music-business) hologram concert; there was [Tupac at Coachella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbrFmPBV0Y) in 2012, Michael Jackson at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, Ol' Dirty Bastard hologramming with the Wu-Tang clan in 2013, and [Chief Keef](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chief-keef-hologram-concert-shut-down-by-police-20150726)'s controversial hologram concert in Chicago that got shut down earlier this year. 

So, how cheap does the technology need to be before we can get a hologram Callas? Or Hologram Pav? Pavogram? Would it be entertaining/sacrilegious/terrifying to put the likes of Birgit Nilsson or Alfredo Kraus into the *Regie*-type Wagner and Verdi productions of today? How meta would that be? Opera galas could become mighty exciting with special holographic appearances of Callas or Caruso or Sutherland. I'm looking at you, Metropolitan Opera.

In the meantime, here's my favourite of the holo-concerts so far: Michael Jackson's posthumous performance at the Billboard Music Awards:
