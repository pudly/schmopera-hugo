## Can you describe a day in the life of an apprentice singer at Santa Fe Opera?

A day in the life of an apprentice singer at the Santa Fe Opera is pretty amazing.  We are in rehearsals usually from 10am to 5pm, working on our various roles or cover assignments for the summer.  We also have coachings with the music staff and guest teachers and coaches at various points throughout the day.  When it's production week for a show or a performance day, you will find us in the theater getting our costumes on and performing on one of the most amazing stages on the planet.  It's a large amount of work, but we absolutely love it!  When we aren't working, you'll see us hanging out with our friends! 

## What appealed to you about the apprentice program?

Everything about the Santa Fe Opera made me want to apply for the apprentice program.  I had dreamt of working here for a long time, after hearing my teacher and her husband speak so fondly of the company.  It was a dream come true when I got the job! 

## What do you think is an important part of being a good understudy?

I think being prepared musically, alert in staging rehearsals and a good colleague make for a good understudy.

## How have you been spending your free time outside of rehearsals?

Outside of rehearsals I have been preparing music, going out to eat, working out at Santa Fe Spa, going to Ojo Caliente, and going to Bandelier National Park!

## Are there any highlights of the summer you’re particularly looking forward to?

I'm very much looking forward to all of our performances, but particularly excited about our apprentice scenes!
