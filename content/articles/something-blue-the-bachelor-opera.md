If you liked [*Connection Lost (The Tinder Opera)*](/has-everyone-seen-the-tinder-opera/), you'll love the latest collaboration between composer/tenor [Scott Joiner](/scene/people/scott-joiner/) and writer/director Adam Taylor.

*Something Blue: The Bachelor Opera* is another misguided love story, unpacking everything that's totally bizarre about reality dating & marriage shows. Joiner sings the role of the Bachelor, and soprano [Jessica Fishenfeld](/scene/people/jessica-fishenfeld/) is his new - and perfect - bride.

Joiner and Taylor's latest work is a compact, clever, and cute approach to combining film and opera; there's great singing, and attention to detail that keeps you watching.

**Quick note:** there are scenes that may not be safe for work (depending on where you work).
