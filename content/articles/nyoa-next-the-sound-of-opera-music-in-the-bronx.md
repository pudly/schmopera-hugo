New York Opera Alliance (NYOA) began the first leg of its plan to bring opera concerts to all five boroughs of New York City. They are one fifth of the way there, having completed a concert on April 22nd in the historic Bronx House on Pelham Parkway in the East Bronx. Seven opera companies from NYOA's fifty company membership, performed arias and duets from familiar operas and from some upcoming productions which are part of the NYOANext! Festival. The small but appreciative crowd heard familiar excerpts from Verdi and Gounod, as well as lesser-known pieces and even some new work. 

The most propitious teaser was from the upcoming production by the little OPERA theatre of ny in association with the National Black Theatre and Harlem Opera Theater. From May 31 through June 6th, they will be producing _American One Acts, a double bill_, which will bring together _Highway 1, U.S.A_ by William Grant Still and _Down in the Valley_ by Kurt Weill. William Grant Still (1895-1978,) who is considered part of the Harlem Renaissance of black artists who thrived during the 1920s and 1930s, wrote close to two hundred classical compositions, including nine operas. He is the first black composer whose work was performed by a major American opera company (New York City Opera.)

Soprano Victoria Davis performed an aria from _Highway 1, U.S.A_ and then she was joined by tenor James Reginald Hopkins III for a duet from the same piece. It proved to be an impressive preview. Both singers were in splendid voice and gave performances above and beyond the concert format. They appeared ready to "open," even though the actual production isn't for another month. One hopes that the little OPERA theatre of ny has found another rare gem. They did a fine job with the seldom-seen Benjamin Britten opera _Owen Wingrave_ ([reviewed here](https://www.schmopera.com/hearing-the-seldom-seen/)).

While NYOA's stated ambition was to bring opera to the Bronx, you can almost hear the leaders of [Bronx Opera](https://bronxopera.org/) (which has been around since 1967) and The Lighthouse Opera saying in a loud Bronx accent, "Hey! There's already opera up here!" And indeed, both companies are located in the Bronx and were represented in the concert. Sopranos Lindsay Nakatani and Courtney San Martin from Bronx Opera, sang an excerpt from Poulenc's _Dialogues of the Carmelites_ which was presented in its entirety a few weeks later. The singers were introduced as "covers," and, as a tribute to understudies everywhere, they were pitch perfect.

The always reliable [Regina Opera](http://www.reginaopera.org/) sent tenor Percy Martinez and Brian Montgomery to perform a duet from _Otello_. (Regina Opera's current production is not the tragic _Otello_ but rather the light-hearted _The Student Prince_, May 13, 14, 20 and 21.) Mr. Martinez began with singing "No puede ser!" a poignant aria from _La tabernera del puerto_, a zarzuela by Pablo Sorozabal. Then Mr. Martinez (as Otello) and Mr. Montgomery (as Iago) launched into some Verdi fireworks.

Several companies have no upcoming performances listed on their websites, but sent singing representatives to the concert. 

Of the best, Encompass Opera Theatre sent soprano Sara Lemesh to perform a heart-breaking aria as Emily from Ned Rorem's _Our Town_, and a trillingly thrilling and intense "Juliet's Waltz" from Gounod's _Romeo et Juliette_. Opera Praktikos was represented by soprano Shanley Horvitz who sang "Lady of the Shield Arm, Rise Up," music by Del'Shawn Taylor and libretto by Marianna Mott Newirth, an aria based on _The Lord of the Rings_. This one snippet was good enough to make one wonder if they will expand on the material.

There are many other opera companies listed on the [NYOA website](https://www.nyoperaalliance.org/). Note: some of the links to organizations on the website haven't been updated in a while.
