On **Monday, February 22nd at Toronto's Four Seasons Centre**, the [Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/TheMarriageofFigaro/FigaroEnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx) takes the main stage for their performance of Mozart's [*The Marriage of Figaro*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/TheMarriageofFigaro/FigaroEnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx). The Ensemble Studio takes on the task of understudying the main cast, on top of countless hours of preparation for their very special night. Each year, one performance of the COC's season is reserved for their young artists, and it's an annual highlight for listeners interested in the up-and-comers of Canada's opera scene.

We had the chance to chat with the Ensemble Studio cast, and catch a sneak peek of them in rehearsal. For details and ticket information for *The Marriage of Figaro* on February 22nd, follow our box office links below.
