Whether you're dealing with lion- or lamb-like weather, March offers some good operatic and musical picks on both coasts (and a little bit the Midwest).

In Chicago, Haymarket Opera Company continues its season with Luigi Rossi's [*Oratorio per la Settimana Santa*](http://www.haymarketopera.org/rossi/), the third of their annual Lenten oratorios. Rossi's work, written ~1640, is one of the earliest known Passions. Craig Trompeter takes on double duty as bass violinist and music director, leading a chamber orchestra and singers Carrie Henneman Shaw as The Virgin Mary, Mark Haddad as Pilate, and Demons Kaitlin Foley, Drew Mintner, William Dwyer, and Mischa Bouvier.

Performances happen **March 8 at 5:45pm** at The Chicago Temple (77 W Washington St.), and **March 10 at 5pm** at Church of the Atonement (5749 N Kenmore Ave.). Tickets start at $10 - [click here for details](http://www.haymarketopera.org/rossi/), or read the [program book here.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55b3b5d7e4b049454c0f51c9/t/5a9585118165f5f7bd74be67/1519748370252/2018_Oratorio+per+la+Settimana+Santa_web.pdf)

**March 16, 8pm** at Lincoln Center's David Geffen Hall, the National Chorale presents the New York premiere of Angela Rice's Easter oratorio, *Thy Will Be Done*.
