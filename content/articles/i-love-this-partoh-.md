Let me share what I think is a common source of frustration for pianists learning operas. You're playing along (sight-reading like a pro), maybe missing a few notes here and there, but getting the general sound of the show, and you get to that _really famous_ part in that opera. Like, "Ride of the Valkyries"/"Largo al factotum"/"Toreador Song" famous. For example, I got caught in the augmented-triad trap _and_ the modes-not-scales trap recently with that tricky beauty, _Madama Butterfly_. And you realize it's sort of harder to play than you expected (especially the Valkyries bit, eep). You're in a wonky key (why didn't you know it was in that key?), and there are more notes than you remember hearing. Or it's jumpy, and you keep missing the bass note. (*cough* _anvilchorus_) And this is generally the _status quo_ when you're sight-reading through a new piece. But it's _so frustrating_ when it's a famous bit. Am I right? [That scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZzTv0Sb4Zg) in _Il barbiere di Siviglia_, anyone?
"Ride of the Valkyries" for scale:
