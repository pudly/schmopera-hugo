This month Vancouver's [Opera Mariposa](/scene/companies/opera-mariposa/), a company "run by young artists, for young artists", presents [*Toward Tomorrow*](http://operamariposa.com/schedule), a something-for-everyone event with a great cause.

Opera Mariposa co-founder Jacqueline Ko wrote *Toward Tomorrow* as a way to raise awareness for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (often referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), a disease from which she has suffered since the age of six.

"ME can change your life forever - it definitely did for me," says Ko. "I've read studies that compare ME's impact to multiple sclerosis, late-stage cancer or congestive heart failure. Yet there's barely any research funding, most medical schools don't even teach this disease, and they say as many as 9 out of 10 people aren't even diagnosed. I was lucky in that respect - but even with a diagnosis, we don't fully understand the cause or have a cure."

Despite living with ME, Ko has become an acclaimed singer and producer; her story is told in Valerie Free's book, [*Lighting Up a Hidden World: CFS and ME*](http://www.valeriefree.org/). Ko notes that for many with the disease, "symptoms are only half the struggle. The other half is dealing with widespread public misconceptions and a lack of medical support."

Since starting Opera Mariposa, Ko's performances have raised over $50,000 in support of treatment, education, and research of chronic neuroimmune disease.

[*Toward Tomorrow*](http://operamariposa.com/schedule) happens **June 16, 7:30pm**, at Vancouver's Marpole United Church, and it combines operatic arias from *The Magic Flute* and *L'elisir d'amore*, Broadway hits from *Hamilton* and *West Side Story*, and more. Ko will be joined by mezzo-soprano Brittony LeFever, tenor Lyndon Ladeur, and pianist Nina Horvath. 

Plus, the show includes a dessert buffet, and a raffle contest.

"Organizations like the ME/FM Society of BC do amazing work, and I think things are shifting," says Ko, optimistic about the progress she has seen in her own lifetime. "People are waking up to the widespread impact of this disease - now, we need research funding and public health policy to catch up, and I want to do what I can to help make that happen."
