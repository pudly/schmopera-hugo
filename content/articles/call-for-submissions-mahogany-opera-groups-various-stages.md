[Mahogany Opera Group](/scene/companies/mahogany-opera-group/) is inviting artists to submit their ideas for their 2017 [Various Stages](http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/productions/various-stages/) Festival.

A Mahogany creation, with the aim to test and challenge new ideas in opera and music theatre, Various Stages is an annual programme that offers selected artists the chance to put their projects through various workshops, sharings, and public showings, with support given along the way.

Mahogany asks for artists to send their proposals by **12pm on July 29, 2016**, to [recruitment@mahoagnyoperagroup.co.uk](mailto:recruitment@mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk).

"Entrants should be keen to take bold creative risks and push the boundaries of style and form, and have an existing relationship with a venue, promoter or production house which could endorse and support the project."

Successful projects will be announced in September 2016. Workshops will begin in January 2017, and the results will be presented in Various Stages Festival in February 2017 over two days.

"Various Stages blurs the line between process and performance, allowing artists to share their work process with audiences and stakeholders. The programme aims to encourage creative exchange, demystify the art form and ensure that each work has public context and relevance."
