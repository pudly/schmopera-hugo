Pianist, coach and voice teacher Gerald Martin Moore works with, well, everybody. He's in demand as a coach, teacher and pianist for the likes of Renée Fleming, Joyce DiDonato, and Sarah Connolly, and he [interviewed the spectacular Beverly Sills](http://www.beverlysillsonline.com/articles/beverly-%20sills-article.htm). Gerald is a vocal consultant for Decca Records, and and he's recorded with Sondra Radvanovsky and Danielle de Niese. You can hear him during the [Met's Saturday matinee broadcasts](http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/broadcast/operainfo.aspx?sn=watch) as the host of the Metropolitan Opera Quiz. Above all, he teaches voice, and I got to ask him a few questions about singers and singing. Enjoy.
