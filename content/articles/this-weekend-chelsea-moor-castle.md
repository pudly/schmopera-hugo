Toronto-area fans of Gilbert and/or Sullivan are in luck this weekend. The [North Toronto Players](http://www.northtorontoplayers.com/current-show) present *Chelsea Moor Castle (or the Contract to Marry)*, a mash-up of music from *HMS Pinafore*, *Pirates of Penzance*, *Iolanthe*, *The Mikado*, *The Gondoliers*, *Ruddigore* and more, by Michael Harms and Barb Scheffler.

*Chelsea Moor Castle* had its world premiere on March 4th, but there are still four chances to hear it this coming weekend, at **Jubilee United Church, 40 Underhill Drive, Toronto**. If you like bang for your buck as much as you like G&S, this is the show for you. Tickets start at $15, and kids under 14 get in free. For full details and to purchase tickets, follow our box office links below.
