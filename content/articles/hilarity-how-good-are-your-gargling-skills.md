Happily, we stumbled across this video of Canadian soprano, actress and cabaret singer [Lindsay Sutherland Boal](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6358863/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm), collaborating with the always funny Rainer Hersch on a version of Adele's Laughing Song that you've likely never heard before.

Hersch is famous for having fun with classical music, and poking fun at "serious" opera repertoire by [adding his own "misheard lyrics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjeQtbKFlHc) to the surtitles.

Torontonians may remember Sutherland Boal from her work with Against the Grain Theatre (*La bohème* *Seven Deadly Sins (and holier fare)*). Here, she pulls out her comedy chops with this bit from *Die Fledermaus*, including a second verse that's equal parts hilarity and impressive technique.

Honestly, can't you just picture her practicing this at home? Our bet is that many of you are now off to test your gargle-singing skills.
