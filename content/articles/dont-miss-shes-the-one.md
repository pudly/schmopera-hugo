Next **Friday, April 8th, 7:30pm** at Heliconian Hall, [Essential Opera](/scene/companies/essential-opera/) presents *She's The One*, a concert that celebrates and explores women's lives, through excerpts from Canadian and American contemporary opera.

Sopranos [Maureen Batt](/scene/people/maureen-batt/) and [Erin Bardua](/scene/people/erin-bardua/), co-founders and co-Artistic Directors of Essential Opera, will perform alongside [Maureen Ferguson](/scene/people/maureen-ferguson/) and [Julie Ludwig](/scene/people/julie-ludwig/), with pianist and Music Director [Cheryl Duvall](http://www.thethinedgenewmusiccollective.com/artists), of the Thin Edge New Music Collective. 

"Women are at the centre of each story in this programme," says Bardua. "Some are tied together by classic Canadian imagery, like tempestuous weather and isolation. Others are more intimate and personal - mother-daughter relationships, or questioning sexuality."

*She's The One* includes music by Leslie Uyeda, Elizabeth Raum, Anna HÃ¶stman, Anna Pidgorna, Fiona Ryan, John Estacio, and Jake Heggie. "We get to feature several fantastic artists," says Batt, "and present these wonderful works to an audience that may not have had a chance to hear many of them before."

Tickets start at $20, available [online](https://bemusednetwork.com/events/detail/219) and at the door. For full details and to reserve your seat, follow our box office links below.
