We've written [quite a lot about child singers](/baby-opera-singers-getting-angry-for-the-right-reasons/), and the odd combination of talented kids and big-budget TV talent shows.

So, it's entirely refreshing to hear 13-year old [Aksel Rykkvin](https://youtu.be/rVoIRS9vA3s), Norwegian boy soprano. With early classical training, Rykkvin has already appeared with Norwegian National Opera; now, he has released an album of arias by Mozart, Handel and Bach, with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under conductor Nigel Short.

Recorded in London in January 2016 and set for release on September 2 on [Signum Classics](http://www.signumrecords.com/), Rykkvin funded the album with a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/112214953/aksel-rykkvin-and-the-oae-cd-recording), raising nearly $45,000. His natural musicianship is backed by impressive technique and a smart use of his young voice; in a word, his singing is completely charming. 

You can whet your appetite with the video below, where Rykkvin sings the finale of J.S. Bach's BWV 51, "Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen". Also, have a look at this [short documentary](https://youtu.be/rVoIRS9vA3s) about the young singer's career so far, and his collaboration with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.
