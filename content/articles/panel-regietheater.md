preamble: |-
  Today, we're really excited to present our very first panel discussion, on the topic of Regietheater. With the help of videographer [Jeff Higgins](http://jeffhiggins.ca), we captured an extended conversation with some of Canada's most opera-savvy folks. The question of interpreting opera led to the unpacking of topics, like what it means to say a piece is done in its "original form." I was even able to include a couple of queries from readers.

  Many thanks go to the seven members of our panel, who I'll introduce by seating arrangement, left to right:

  - Robert Harris, arts writer, [*The Globe and Mail*](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/topic/Robert-Harris)
  - Wayne Gooding, editor, [*Opera Canada*](http://www.operacanada.ca/)
  - [Lydia Perović](http://www.lydiaperovic.com/index.html), arts writer & journalist, *Opera Canada*, *Definitely the Opera*
  - [Alexander Neef](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/AlexanderNeef.aspx), general director, Canadian Opera Company
  - [Michael Mori](https://tapestryopera.com/about/who-we-are/#mori), artistic director, Tapestry Opera
  - [Krisztina Szabó](http://www.krisztinaszabo.com/), mezzo-soprano
  - [Joel Ivany](http://www.joelivany.com/index/welcome.html), artistic director, Against the Grain Theatre

## Get to the point:
