Long-time champions of new opera, [Tête a Tête](/scene/companies/tete-a-tete/) has established a new hub for fans of contemporary works.

Only recently has there been a mini-explosion of places to hear opera from the comfort of one's laptop - The Metropolitan Opera's On Demand subscription, Operavision, various company-presented live-streams - but Tête a Tête's new YouTube channel, [MyNewOpera](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvUpB2Q-JTgd5iPJMwcWpA), is the first of its kind dedicated to brand new works.

An extension of Tête à Tête's [On Demand](https://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/on-demand/) collection, MyNewOpera offers a playlist of works presented by Tête a Tête, and also [open to uploads](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvUpB2Q-JTgd5iPJMwcWpA/about) by anyone making new opera. (For details on that, check out their [step-by-step process](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvUpB2Q-JTgd5iPJMwcWpA/about).)

MyNewOpera is searchable by composer, theme, artist, and synopsis, making it a valuable resource for those curious what's happening among opera's small companies and even works-in-progress.

Currently, MyNewOpera is releasing an Advent Calendar of videos, which kicked off with the channel's December 3rd launch. 

So, [start perusing!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYvUpB2Q-JTgd5iPJMwcWpA)
