  Mother's Day was this past weekend, and I spent it chatting with my mom on camera. Bonus: she's a singer and voice teacher who works with students of all ages. The timing was perfect to have [Edwina Douglas](https://twitter.com/edwinasings) talk about teaching teenagers, how parents can support their musically-inclined kids, and why she loves her work.

  I know you'll all love her.

  Happy Mother's Day, mom!
