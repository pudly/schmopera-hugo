If you're in the Boston area this month, count yourself lucky. [WholeTone Opera](http://wholetoneopera.com/), a new company devoted to working with women composers, is presenting *La Zombiata: A Zombie Opera*, **February 12-14 at Davis Square Theater** in Somerville, MA. The opera is by Jillian Flexner, and it's a comedy loosely based on Verdi's infamous *La traviata*. 

"Our story begins in a Parisian penthouse infested by an undead hoard lead by Xenobia, huntress of humans. As the minions mingle at a bloody soiree, romantically inclined Christolpho meets the ravenous-yet-rapturous Philonia. Suddenly, all-too-human emotions come into play, leading to chaos, comedy, and a splash-zone worthy chainsaw massacre."

I mean, *come on*. 

Plus, the **10:30pm show on February 13th** has a splash zone, and everyone is encouraged to come dressed like a zombie.

So, if you're up for a "uniquely morbid Valentineâ€™s Day experience," or if you're like us and your curiosity is killing you (undead joke in there somewhere), please go see this show and tell us all about it.

And if you think a zombie opera is a cool idea, you can help them out by contributing to their [IndieGogo fund](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/raise-the-dead--2#/).
