short_description: Hvorostovsky has cancelled several February dates for Il trovatore
  at the Metropolitan Opera, but we all hope he&#039;s feeling well enough to sing,
  at Toronto&#039;s Koerner Hall, if only for the selfish pleasure of hearing his
  voice (and maybe catching a glimpse of that hair).

Next month at Koerner Hall, you can hear star baritone [Dmitri Hvorostovsky](/scene/people/dmitri-hvorostovsky/) in recital. Presented by Show One Productions on **February 21, 7pm**, Hvorostovsky will be joined by Russian pianist Ivari Ilya, winner of the International Frédéric Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, Poland. 

The pair are stopping in Toronto as part of their recital tour, which includes Muscat, Oman, Talinn, Estonia, Chicago and New York City. After that, Hvorostovsky heads to Salzburg to sing one of his signature roles, Iago in Verdi's *Otello*.

One the programme are songs by Tchaikovsky, Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Richard Strauss. In other words, things Dmitri Hvorostovsky sounds great in.

Hvorostovsky has cancelled several February dates for *Il trovatore* at the [Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/), but we all hope he's feeling well enough to sing, at Toronto's Koerner Hall, if only for the selfish pleasure of hearing his voice (and maybe catching a glimpse of that hair).

Tickets for his February 21st recital start at $60. For full details and to reserve your seat, follow the box office links below.
