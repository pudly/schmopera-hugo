Today's find is oddly satisfying. Opera-loving YouTuber [rexeterna](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt04RwUMa6KP7pjiQLLFQ-w) posted this compilation of ten Heldentenors, each singing the infamous "Wälse! Wälse!" cry from Act I of Wagner's *Die Walküre*. My vote is Vickers (go Canada), but Lauritz Melchior wins for sheer duration.
