If you're one of those folks who get creeped out by clowns, I offer a gentle content warning for the latest item out of Toronto-based chamber group, The Happenstancers.

The ensemble is "the shared vision of clarinetist and visual artist Brad Cherwin, oboist Aleh Remezau, and cellist Sarah Gans", and they've made a name for themselves with their bent for the _avant garde_. And though it's 110 years old, few things sound as cutting edge as Arnold Schoenberg's _Pierrot Lunaire_.

The Happenstancers have released videos of five songs from _Three Times Seven Poems from Albert Girard's "Pierrot Lunaire"_; the film is by Jake Kovnat and produced by Brad Cherwin, and features conductor Simon Rivard on the podium, and soprano Danika Lorèn as everybody's favourite despondent clown, Pierrot.

_Pierrot Lunaire_ translates eerily well to film, especially in the hands of this team. Shot in black and white and with moments of harsh _chiarioscuro_ in Adam Harris' lighting design, we're brought into the delicate world of a chamber group set-up. Lorèn stands upstage, her exaggerated clown's ruff drawing the eye; downstage, Rivard is flanked by pianist Alexander Malikov, cellist Sarah Gans, violinist and violist Hee-See Yoon, clarinetist/bass clarinetist Brad Cherwin, and flautist/piccolist Rebecca Moranis.

The five songs are directed with beautiful attention to the text-music fusion. "Die Kreuze" blends the stark visual of a stained-glass cross with that eerie sound that only Schoenberg seems to get out of a chamber orchestra. It's transparent and light, but in a way that feels off, like sunlight shining through threadbare fabric or an abandoned cobweb dangling from one end. Here, Lorèn introduces us to the unique sound of _Sprechstimme_ -- where the singer inhabits the vocal limbo between singing and speaking -- and it's clear that this iconic piece of atonality is in excellent hands.

Several of the group went to Equilibrium Young Artist Initiative, Barbara Hannigan's program at the Lunenberg Academy of Music; there, Brad approached Simon about conducting. Barbara and EQ helped fund this project.

This month The Happenstancers are doing more Pierrot-inspired repertoire: Stravinsky 3 Japanese Lyrics, Delage Quatre Poemes Hindous, and Ravel Mallarmes Songs

Die Kreuze

* crosses in stained-glass windows of church
* First taste of sprechstimme from Danika, eerie Schoenberg orchestration where it's transparent, but like a near-see-through piece of fabric, something dangling or exposed

Galgenlied

* terrifying, robotic, brief, sing-songy like a drunk clown

Rote Messe

* thick and plodding, like something sticky on your shoe
* song is a long pan in, like we've stumbled upon a happening

Der Mondfleck

* fab lighting work by Adam Harris, a small and frantically moving spotlight, capturing a bit of everyone but never long enough to see what's really happening
* frantic and unreasonable, like Pierrot

Nacht

* spider scuttles
* Danika stares with blackness in her eyes
* ur-sounds, otherworldly rumbles like groans
* when the sound rises up, it's wrong, sinister brightness
*
