The Happenstancers have recorded five songs of _Three Times Seven Poems from Albert Girard's "Pierrot Lunaire"_

Film by Jake Kovnat, produced by Brad Cherwin

Several of the group went to Equilibrium Young Artist Initiative, Barbara Hannigan's program at the Lunenberg Academy of Music; there, Brad approached Simon about conducting. Barbara and EQ helped fund this project.

This month The Happenstancers are doing more Pierrot-inspired repertoire: Stravinsky 3 Japanese Lyrics, Delage Quatre Poemes Hindous, and Ravel Mallarmes Songs

Die Kreuze

* crosses in stained-glass windows of church
* First taste of sprechstimme from Danika, eerie Schoenberg orchestration where it's transparent, but like a near-see-through piece of fabric, something dangling or exposed

Galgenlied

* terrifying, robotic, brief, sing-songy like a drunk clown

Rote Messe

* thick and plodding, like something sticky on your shoe
* song is a long pan in, like we've stumbled upon a happening

Der Mondfleck

* fab lighting work by Adam Harris, a small and frantically moving spotlight, capturing a bit of everyone but never long enough to see what's really happening
* frantic and unreasonable, like Pierrot

Nacht

* spider scuttles
* Danika stares with blackness in her eyes
* ur-sounds, otherworldly rumbles like groans
* when the sound rises up, it's wrong, sinister brightness
*
