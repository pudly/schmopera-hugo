[Topher Mokrzewski](http://www.christophermokrzewski.com/Home/Christopher_Mokrzewski.html) is a man of many hats. As Music Director of [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), he has been the musical mind behind most of AtG Theatre's projects, including the Dora Award-winning _Figaro's Wedding_. Topher recently wrapped up a season as [Calgary Opera](http://www.calgaryopera.com/)'s Resident Conductor, and his next stop is the [Banff Centre for the Arts](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/), for the inevitable [_#UncleJohn_](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/). I caught up with him in a small window of respite from the travel and work; he entertained my questions amid boxes, packed to move house. Topher talks about messing with Mozart, having a "mountain experience," and packing the right shoes for Banff.

Stay tuned to meet the rest of the #UncleJohn creative team, and to catch what’s happening during our time in Banff. [Click here for details](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/) about the shows, running August 1-3, 2014 at the Cave and Basin National Historic Site.
