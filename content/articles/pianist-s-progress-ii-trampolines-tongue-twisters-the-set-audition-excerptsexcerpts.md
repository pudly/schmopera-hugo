Having established that most auditions require the "Elton John Act", any sane person usually asks "why"? After all, we didn't get into opera because of our beautiful singing voices. I have wondered on more than one occasion whether répétiteur auditions are simply some kind of twisted fun for the panel, who enforce the suffering only because they all had to go through it themselves in their youth.

The answer usually given is that we need to be prepared for rehearsals where one of the singers may be away or ill. In theory when this happens, the répétiteur should be prepared to "sing in" the vocal lines of the singer who is indisposed. In my experience the conductor is actually the one who often likes to do this, leaving a slightly disgruntled répétiteur rueing the hours they spent preparing the vocal lines using a singing voice which their mother still says "sounds nice". It is of course also completely unrealistic that you will ever have to sing every vocal line while playing as you do in an audition, because if the singers are all sick, the management will most likely cancel the rehearsal completely, unless they are hinting to you that you need more practice. As a result, you may well think it pointless that répétiteurs are asked to perform this extravaganza of a one- man or woman show. 

Well, not quite.

## Getting used to multi-tasking

Getting a répétiteur to sing and play at the same time is actually a very good way of finding out who is the best person to take on the general multi-tasking role that is the core of the job. As soon as a candidate starts playing and it's clear that their head is buried in the music, or they are staring at their fingers and generally not engaging with the drama of the piece they are meant to be bringing to life, they give themselves away. They reveal through their body language that their musical intentions are not really oriented outwards, but rather inwards, in a way that is not going to support anybody. 

> The set repertoire that is usually chosen is full of drama, intrigue, power and passion. If the répétiteur can show this through their singing, then it is clear that they have the sense for drama that is only going to enrich an opera house. 

If the ideal répétiteur is like an Olympic-sized trampoline, supporting the other athletes in their work while remaining flexible, this insular kind of pianist is more like a concrete block. Sure, it may support you quite well up to a point, but after a few minutes of jumping, things are going to get quite uncomfortable.  As I mentioned above, whether the person is a trampoline or concrete block unfortunately becomes pretty clear after the first few lines of music that they play.
