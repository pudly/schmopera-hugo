Looking for something to tide you over between the annual stretch of Christmas-New Year's-Regular Life? Want a way to get some catchy songs in your head that aren't Christmas carols? Me too. Luckily, you can catch [Toronto Operetta Theatre](http://www.torontooperetta.com/index.html)'s production of _The Mikado_, from December 27th to January 4th. There's even a [New Year's Eve Gala performance](https://boxoffice.stlc.com/public/show.aspx), with a pre-show reception at the nearby [HotHouse Restaurant and Bar](http://www.hothousecafe.com/), and post-show dancing and midnight champagne. Bass-baritone http://www.gilestomkins.com/ Giles Tomkins makes his TOT debut with the title role, which I'm pretty excited about, and http://luciacesaroni.com/ Lucia Cesaroni and https://twitter.com/aitkramer Adrian Kramer take the stage as Yum-Yum and Nanki-Poo. “Gilbert and Sullivan’s world of music and text needs singer/actors of extraordinary talent and I’m pleased we’ve been able to assemble a cast with a talent for both,” says TOT General Director [Guillermo Silva-Marin](http://www.torontooperetta.com/about.html#u457-24). The whole cast is Canadian (#eh!), including baritone and Schmopera contributor [Gregory Finney](/author/greg/) on opening night as Pish Tush. Maestro [Derek Bate](http://www.torontooperetta.com/artists.html#u1867) conducts, and Silva-Marin directs.
So come and see _The Mikado_, [at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Dec. 27-Jan. 4](https://boxoffice.stlc.com/public/default.asp?cgCode=2&cgName=Toronto%20Operetta%20Theatre), for the memorable tunes and the great Canadian onstage talent. Tickets are available [right here](https://boxoffice.stlc.com/public/default.asp?cgCode=2&cgName=Toronto%20Operetta%20Theatre).

In the meantime, I leave you with this Mikado moment from Frasier Crane.
