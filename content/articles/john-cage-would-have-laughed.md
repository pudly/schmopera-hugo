  this is officially a topical digression. Concerning the above screenshot, possible
  explanations include a) a hilarious coincidence concerning copyright infringement,
  b) John Cage is haunting AdamLore and his YouTube channel, or c) AdamLore infringed
  upon copyright knowing that this would be perfect.
