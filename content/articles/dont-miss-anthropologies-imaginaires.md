Canadian composer [Gabriel Dharmoo](/scene/people/gabriel-dharmoo/) is set to bring his award-winning *Anthropologies imaginaires* to this year's [SummerWorks Performance Festival](https://apps.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=77a4481bec72d470d30eb8ceeac384a8&vqitq=b9f9ea4f-51d4-42ac-8475-a9a1b32abe7a&vqitp=16c9dcf9-9299-4881-b9f4-4c9d75996cfa&vqitts=1468851556&vqitc=vendini&vqite=itl&vqitrt=Safetynet&vqith=85977537fcd4e0d593d13a7c732ea577).

Named Best International Production at the 2015 Amsterdam Fringe Festival, *Anthropologies imaginaires* is a one-man-show of sorts, paired with a video mockumentary.

"The experts on screen comment on invented vocal traditions demonstrated by the singer-performer. Various odd or isolated vocal expressions from around the world are woven together and revisited through imaginary folklore and experimental voice techniques, showcasing the virtuosity, versatility, and strangeness of the human voice."
