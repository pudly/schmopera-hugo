short_description: Is it just us, or should GoPro footage become a staple of any opera

  among the Czech Philharmonic, including on the ends of trombones, the bottoms of
  cellos, and on the owner of the best seat in the house, the timpanist.

Is it just us, or should GoPro footage become a staple of any opera or concert broadcast? Here at Schmopera, we're big fans of strapping a camera onto conductor, singers, really [anyone willing to wear one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1A3Dfi-Wo). So, we were delighted to find this clip of maestro Manfred Honeck and the Czech Philharmonic playing Janáček's *Jenůfa Suite* in Dvořák Hall, Prague. GoPro planted 24 cameras among the orchestra, including on the ends of trombones, the bottoms of cellos, and on the owner of the best seat in the house, the timpanist. 

Totally neat. For more GoPro goodness, check out [Anthony Pappano's maestro-cam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiIo16E1VtY) clip from the Royal Opera House, or have a #throwback moment and check out our [Leporello-cam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1A3Dfi-Wo) from [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/)'s *#UncleJohn* at The Banff Centre.
