On February 10th at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre, [Soundstreams](/scene/companies/soundstreams/) presents *Squeezebox*, a "cross-cultural concert celebrating all things accordion". 

Canadian accordionist [Joseph Macerollo](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/joseph-macerollo-emc/) is joined by along with one of his current protégés, 22-year old [Michael Bridge](http://www.michaelbridgemusic.com/), as well as [bandoneon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandoneon) player [Héctor del Curto](http://www.hectordelcurto.com/), and [saenghwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saenghwang) player [gamin](http://gamin-music.com/profile). 

*Squeezebox* explores music by Astor Piazzola, Alexina Louie, and Marjan Mozetich, as well as new works by [Anna Pidgorna](http://www.annapidgorna.com/), alumna of Soundstreams' Emerging Composer Workshop.

Macerollo will also play one of over 200 works composed for him by R. Murray Schafer, the "surreal" *La testa d'Adriana*, with fab soprano [Carla Huhtanen](/scene/people/carla-huhtanen/). "Dressed in a tattered tuxedo and top hat, he lures the audience to his side show, the bodiless head of a woman saved at the instant before her death. She is awakened by his music and sings an aria of gurgles, trills, whispers, and pops before subsiding once again into her comatose state."

In our experience, watching Carla Huhtanen perform is a highlight of any show, and *La testa d'Adriana* seems like the kind of piece to pull the best out of her. Plus, *Squeezebox* offers up a night of novelty in a beautiful space.
