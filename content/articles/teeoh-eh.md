If you're a subscriber to our [newsletter](/get-our-newsletter-stay-in-the-loop/), you've already heard the good news: [Jenna](/authors/jenna-douglas/) is heading back across the pond, to her beloved Toronto (#the6ix!).

It's been a year and change of fantastic musical experiences here in London. The companies have been generous and welcoming, the shows have been full of ear- and eye-candy, and the sheer quantity of operatic offerings have been a total treat.

One of the best parts about coming home, is that Schmopera's presence in the UK won't come to a halt. We're thrilled that London-based contributor [Collin Shay](/authors/collin-shay/) is all set to cover the upcoming gems at Covent Garden, Wigmore Hall, and even the Glyndebourne Festival. "I'm so excited to represent one of my favorite blogs on the internet!" says Shay, flatteringly. "I'm looking forward to experiencing opera in a ton of different capacities, and hope I can convince some other people to experience it too!"

It's with pride that Schmopera leaves its mark in London, one of the world's cultural hubs. Perspective is a beautiful thing, and it's one of the most valuable things that will come back to Toronto this spring.
