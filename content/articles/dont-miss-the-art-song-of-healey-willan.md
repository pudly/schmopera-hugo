On **November 18, 7:30pm** at Trinity-St. Paul's, the [Canadian Art Song Project](/scene/companies/canadian-art-song-project/) presents [*The Art Song of Healey Willan*](http://www.canadianartsongproject.ca/concert-season/), celebrating some of the unpublished songs by the Anglo-Canadian composer and organist. 

After emigrating from London to Toronto in 1913, Willan worked as choirmaster and organist for St. Paul's, Bloor Street, and later as Precentor for the Church of St. Mary Magdalene. He also composed roughly 800 works, many of them sacred choral works, and over 100 songs for piano and voice.

Continuing their history of performance and research of Canadian composers, the Canadian Art Song Project has transcribed and edited several of Willan's songs, previously available only in manuscript in the national archives in Ottawa; the programme also includes songs that have been out of publication for over 10 years.

Willan's music will be performed by soprano Martha Guth, mezzo-soprano [Allyson McHardy](/scene/people/allyson-mchardy/), baritone [Peter Barrett](/scene/people/peter-barrett/), pianist Helen Becqué, and organist Matthew Whitfield.

A pre-concert chat will also be hosted by Canadian composer Dean Burry, starting at 6:30pm.

Tickets start at $20, and you can get yours [right here.](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/canadian-art-song-project/events/the-art-song-of-healey-willan/)
