Baritone [Aaron Durand](http://twitter.com/gingervanni) is new to Toronto, originally hailing from 100 Mile House, British Columbia. If you caught [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/unclejohn)'s production of *#UncleJohn*, either in Banff, AB, or in Toronto, you caught his charmingly protective performance of Masetto. Aaron is a thoughtful guy, and he agreed to chat. He talks about why he loves what he does, and what he learns from playing characters like the Masetto and Count Almaviva.
