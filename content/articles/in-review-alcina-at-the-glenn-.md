Chorus is expensive

Start-up opera doesn't have it, but people don't often miss it

Creative choices of work

Choruses aren't really what people get excited over anyway

People deserve to be paid enough for their work, but ignoring reality isn't good either

Chorus and opera house - two huge, insurmountable expenses that new companies have to deal with immediately

Startup operas - they go without chorus and a venue - when they get one or both of these things, it's seen as a big step up

New commissions are happening from these small companies, giving a big proportion of their available funds to new works, compared to large-budget companies - this means that a huge amount of new opera is being written for chamber-sized performances, without chorus (Devil Inside, M'Dea Undone)

Large companies are aware of this - it's likely one of the reasons they include a sans-chorus opera or two in their season
