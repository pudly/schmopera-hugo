Winnipeg-born [Tom Diamond](http://www.catalysttcm.com/tomdiamond.html) is one of Canada's busiest, most sought-after opera directors. His work has earned him both Dora (Chan Ka Nin's _Iron Road_) and Gemini awards ([_Bathroom Divas: So You Want To Be an Opera Star?_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNr3dUKocPU) on Bravo!), and he's in huge demand as an operatic acting coach to young professional singers. I first met Tom on the summer program circuit close to ten years ago, and every time I get to work with him, I get inspired and learn something (I'm sure many readers have their own great Tom-Diamond-memories). His extensive resume includes productions with the Canadian Opera Company, [Tapestry New Opera Works](https://tapestryopera.com/tom-diamond), Pacific Opera Victoria, Opera Lyra, and he coaches young singers in the [COC Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx), and [L'opéra de Montréal's Atelier lyrique](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/emerging-artists/atelier-lyrique). Over at the [Ernest Balmer Studio](https://tapestryopera.com/rent), Tom was willing to let me pick his brain this week, so I could share it with my readers. He spoke about the "Age of the Director", about his mentorship with the late Richard Bradshaw, and about what he learns from great operatic composers. Enjoy.
