Last week, the [_#UncleJohn_](http://www.banffcentre.ca/event/6504/unclejohn?d=2014-08-01+19:30) team was joined by [Alexander Neef](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/AlexanderNeef.aspx), General Director of the Canadian Opera Company. The COC has provided mentorship and support throughout the Open Space program, and while he was here at [The Banff Centre](http://www.banffcentre.ca/event/6504/unclejohn?d=2014-08-01+19:30), the singers had a chance to sing for Mr. Neef and ask him some of their questions about the operatic industry. I had a few moments to talk with Mr. Neef about the unique project that is [_#UncleJohn_](http://atg.schmopera.com/), about bringing opera into the Banff community, and what he'll get up to in his free time in this beautiful corner of Canada.
