  The folks behind [*Something Blue: The Bachelor Opera*](/something-blue-the-bachelor-opera/) and [*Connection Lost: The Tinder Opera*](/has-everyone-seen-the-tinder-opera/) are back! This time, it's *Someone Like Me* (*L'opera di Facebook*), a harrowing tale of likes, validation, and rye toast. Jonathan Hare and Janet Szepei Todd star in the fab, sassy cast of this must-see, written and directed by [Adam Taylor](https://www.galaxy454.com/) with music by Mannes School of Music grad [Nathan Fletcher](https://www.nathanfletchermusic.com/).

  Put down your phone and give it a watch:

  Oh, and the team is already working on their next film. We can't tell you much, except one word: Rumspringa.
