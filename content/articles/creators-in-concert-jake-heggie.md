The National Opera Center continues its *Creators in Concert* series on **March 15, 7pm EST** with a presentation of composer Jake Heggie and selections of his music.

Heggie sees performances of his operas this season at [The Dallas Opera](/scene/comapnies/the-dallas-opera/), [The Atlanta Opera](/scene/companies/the-atlanta-opera/), [Los Angeles Opera](/scene/companies/los-angeles-opera/), and the Kennedy Center, and the time is right to hear him present live excerpts from his work. Heggie will take the piano, along with soprano [Talise Trevigne](/scene/people/talise-trevigne/), mezzo [Elise Quagliata](/scene/people/elise-quagliata/), tenor [Stephen Costello](/scene/people/stephen-costello/) and baritone [Joseph Lattanzi](/scene/people/joseph-lattanzi/). The four singers have been involved in the workshopping and performance history of Heggie's works, and with the in-demand American composer, they'll perform selections from *Moby-Dick*, *Dead Man Walking*, *Three Decembers* and more.
