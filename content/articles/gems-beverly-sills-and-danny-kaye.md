preamble: Because they're both fantastic, the legendary soprano Beverly Sills teamed
  up with actor/comedian/singer Danny Kaye, for a hilarious parody bit on all things
  opera. Sills and Kaye trade short clips of some of opera's most famous tunes. I
  love this kind of stuff, because it shows that a) Kaye knows his stuff (he actually
  conducted a few orchestras in his lifetime, with varying degrees of seriousness)
  and b) Sills is all skill, no ego. Enjoy!
