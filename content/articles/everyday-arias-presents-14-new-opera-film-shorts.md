title: Everyday Arias presents 14 new opera film shorts
---

London-area opera fans and film buffs alike are in for a treat this month. *Everyday Arias* presents a collection of short opera films, to be screened at the Republic Gallery, East India, 2 Clove Crescent, on **January 21, 7-9:00pm**, and at Grosvenor Casino (near Piccadilly Station) on **January 28, 12-2:00pm**.

The 14 short films, featuring both classic operatic excerpts and original scores, have been chosen from around the world, pairing together opera composers and film directors in a new kind of artistic collaboration.

"Although the collaboration between opera and film is not new, we hope to reinvigorate the art form by incorporating the everyday with the extraordinary," says Francesca Levi, creative director of *Everyday Arias*. "This exciting juxtaposition of creative visions will hopefully  prove stimulating for both the die-hard opera fan and new audiences. As the title suggests, it is a very approachable concept of the art form."

The films' stories are diverse: an intoxicated Elvis in a kebab shop, a young ghazal singer pursuing her dreams, a fish who sings its own requiem, and one tenor's take on *Carmina Burana* that promises to be "the biggest, boldest, and sexiest operatic flash mob the internet has ever witnessed."
