We're pretty pumped for [Michael Pecak](/authors/michael-pecak/), the conductor and fortepianist who's also a Schmopera contributor!

Next month, Pecak will make his principal conducting debut with [Chicago Opera Theatre](/scene/companies/chicago-opera-theater/), in the world premiere of _The Beekeeper_. The opera is a one-act with music by Wang Lu and a libretto by Kelley Rourke that hints at mystery and a bit of spookiness.

_The Beekeeper_ is part of COT's [Vanguard Initiative](https://chicagooperatheater.org/vanguard), where the company fosters promising composers — including mentorship from Jake Heggie — and commissions full-length operas.

The premiere, directed by Amy Hutchison and with Pecak on the podium, happens on **March 4, 7:30pm** at the Athenaeum Theater in Chicago.

Toi toi toi, Michael!
