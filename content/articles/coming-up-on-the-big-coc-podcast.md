short_description: Well, Schmopera is officially a veteran of the Big COC Podcast.
  Later this week, mark my third appearance on the COC&#039;s official podcast, joining
  guests Opera Canada editor Wayne Gooding and arts journalist Catherine Kustanczy
  (Hyperalleric, Torontoist). Host extraordinaire Gianmarco Segato will lead a chat
  about the latest current events in the opera world. What will the topics be? A little
  Met, a little elitism; but you&#039;ll have to listen to really find out. In the
  meantime, click here for archives of past episodes of the Big COC Podcast.

A little while ago, I was invited to be a guest on _[The Big COC Podcast](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/Podcasts.aspx)_, hosted by Gianmarco Segato. I joined arts journalist Paula Citron and conductor Stephen Lord in a chat about some of the hotter opera topics. And they let me bring my camera, which means you all get to see a short preview.
