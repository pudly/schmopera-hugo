short_description: Rehearsals for the COC&#039;s Barber of Seville started a few days
  ago, and I had the chance to sit in on the concept discussion, led by director (and
  founder of Els Comediants) Joan Font and associate director Tanya Kane-Parry. They
  showed off some costume and set designs, discussed the Commedia dell&#039;arte,
  and spoke about this story&#039;s web of fascinating characters.
