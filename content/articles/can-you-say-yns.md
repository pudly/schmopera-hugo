short_description: A little bit Stephen Colbert-esque, Nick chats with greats like
  conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin and Emmanuel Ax (or, Yo-Yo Ma&#039;s accompanist)
  about their work. We can&#039;t quite tell if the interviewees knew what they were
  getting into with Nick, but we like it.

A much-needed bit of comedy within the world of classical music, Nick Canellakis has a great ongoing video series called [Conversations wtih Nick Canellakis](http://www.conversationswithnick.com/).

A little bit Stephen Colbert-esque, Nick chats with greats like conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin and [Emmanuel Ax](https://youtu.be/QKCpCzntriE) (or, Yo-Yo Ma's accompanist) about their work. We can't quite tell if the interviewees knew what they were getting into with Nick, but we like it.
