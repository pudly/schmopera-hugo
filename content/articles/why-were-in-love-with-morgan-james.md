In the middle of a [Postmodern Jukebox](http://postmodernjukebox.com/) YouTube blitz, we couldn't help but drop our jaws at the unreal [Morgan James](http://www.morganjamesonline.com/gallery/). The Juilliard-grad-turned-soul-singer-and-songwriter has a voice to stun you, and she has that *thing* where you can't stop watching her.

Want to hear something nuts? Check out the video above, where she covers Aqua's "Barbie Girl" (remember Aqua??) with Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox. For the truly impatient, skip to the "human theramin" bit at 2:07. Like, come on.

After you've done that, head on over to another of her PMJ collaborations (below), this time sharing the vocals with [Haley Reinhart](https://twitter.com/HaleyReinhart) and [Ariana Savalas](https://twitter.com/ArianaSavalas) in some of the sexiest three-part harmony you've ever heard. (Bonus: the four-handed upright bass solo!)
