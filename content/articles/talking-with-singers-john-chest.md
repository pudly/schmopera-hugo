  American baritone [John Chest](/scene/people/john-chest/) is having a pretty stellar season. He was just announced as a [Richard Tucker Foundation Career Grant winner](http://richardtucker.org/), and this June, he'll be heading to Wales to sing as a finalist in the 2017 Cardiff Singer of the World Competition.

  John chatted with us from Philadelphia, where he's set to sing Count Almaviva in Opera Philadelphia's production of [*Le nozze di Figaro*](https://www.operaphila.org/whats-on/on-stage-2016-2017/figaro/), opposite his fianc√©e, [Layla Claire](/talking-with-singers-layla-claire/) as the Countess. He gave us a sneak peek of his upcoming gig in the title role of [*Billy Budd* at Deutsche Oper Berlin](https://www.deutscheoperberlin.de/en_EN/calendar/billy-budd.13757122), and the unique excitement about being a 2017 Cardiff finalist.
