## The Queen of the Night in _Die Zauberflöte_

If you saw the movie _Amadeus_, you chuckled as director Miloš Forman drew a clear comparison between Mozart's shrill mother-in-law and the impossibly high arias he wrote for the Queen of the Night in his infamous _Die Zauberflöte_. Mother to Pamina, the captive maiden whom Tamino helps to "rescue" from Sarastro, the Queen of the Night seems to embody the kind of mom who's super sweet when company is around (ie. princes named Tamino), but seems to bare her claws when left alone with her daughter.

Since you're likely more familiar with her claw-baring aria, we'll treat you to her Act I aria, where she's extra maternal and maybe even a bit flirty with her daughter's would-be boyfriend:

## Klytemnaestra in _Elektra_

They say women are biologically hard-wired to love their kids, but the writers of Greek mythology seem to disagree. Klytemnaestra, mother of Elektra (and others), is the self-made widow of Agamemnon, a title she earned by killing her husband with the help of her lover, Aegisth. Understandably, Elektra isn't too pleased with her mother these days, but when it comes to familial discord, Klytemnaestra seems perfectly fine throwing the blame right back on her daughter.

This is the first time we meet the formidable woman, and in Strauss' opera, Klyemnaestra has a knack for rolling out every abhorrent method of passive-aggressivity in one condensed scene:

## Kostelnička in _Jenůfa_

Technically, Kostelnička Buryjovka is Jenůfa's stepmother, but she still has all the traits of operatic mums. In this truly horrible story, Kostelnička tries to solve the problem of an un-marryable step-daughter, and the baby she had with a guy who no longer wants to be involved; how does she solve the problem? Killing the baby, of course.

The story ends up alright, considering; Kostelnička admits to the crime and goes to jail, but jeez. She kills a baby.

## Gertrud in _Hänsel und Gretel_

On some days, Mutter Gertrud seems like a mean old lady who doesn't like her children; on other days, she just seems like an average mom who's had a long day and doesn't feel like coming home to her kids' noise and mess. If you pay attention to the original story by Hans Christian Andersen, the Mother is equal parts heartless and opportunistic (she's actually a stepmom, getting morbidly realistic about the two kids that she and their dad can't afford). In the opera by Humperdinck, she's a woman with an alcoholic husband, and who can barely support the kids that are dancing like grubby jerks around her tiny little kitchen; she's just basically _had it up to here_.

Also, she feels bad about yelling at her kids, she just doesn't tell _them_ that.

## Azucena in _Il trovatore_

Ah, the whole, "I burned the wrong baby" chestnut. It's pretty horrible, but also so outlandish that Verdi's _Il trovatore_ holds a special place among operas with crazy plots. We go on an emotional rollercoaster, hearing about how Azucena burned a baby alive as payback for the Count who executed her mother over accusations of witchcraft. The burned baby was supposed to be one of the Count's two sons, but apparently Azucena got confused and _burned her own baby by accident_.

Azucena ends up raising Manrico, the younger of the Count's sons, and doesn't tell him he's not her biological son until he's an adult. And in an ultimate twist, Manrico ends up being killed by his older brother - the Count Jr. - who had spent his whole life thinking Azucena had burned his baby brother and was set on revenge.

Insanity! But it makes for great drama, in particular this scene between Azucena and Manrico, when she tells him about his parentage, and her complicated relationship with fire.
