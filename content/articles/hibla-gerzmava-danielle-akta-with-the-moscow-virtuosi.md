Show One Productions continues its great programming this coming **June 8th** at Roy Thomson Hall, with a presentation by The Moscow Virtuosi ensemble with special guests 14-year old Israeli cellist Danielle Atka and world renowned soprano [Hibla Gerzmava](/scene/people/hibla-gerzmava/). 

The Moscow Virtuosi, under the baton of maestro Vladimir Spivakov visits Toronto every couple of years "always to a sold-out hall, with a fresh, new program that brings the audience to its feet." This time around proves to be no exception. Founded in 1979 by Spivakov, a virtuoso violinist in his own right, and friends and colleagues who were currently performing with major classical music outifts in Moscow (many of whom are also huge international competition winners) the name "Moscow Virtuosi" is a very real and true moniker. The chamber ensemble has made their home at the Moscow Performing Arts Centre and enjoys a busy schedule of over 100 performances a year. 

Hailing from a musical family in Israel, at 14 years old, cellist Danielle Atka is already turning heads around the world with her skill and talent. After beginning her studies at age four (feel like a slacker yet? I do...), she received numerous awards, played around the world, and is the recipient of a development grant from the Vladimir Spivakov International Charity Foundation.

Joining the Ensemble as well is soprano Hibla Gerzmava. She's been seen at the Metropolitan Opera as Mimì in *La bohème* and Liù in *Turandot*. In 1994 Ms. Gerzmava won the honour of being the first woman and only vocalist to have won the prestigious Grand Prize in the International Tchaikovsky competition. She will be singing several selections with the group and promises to bring her critically-acclaimed artistry to our Toronto audience. 

Featuring works by Mozart, Shostakovich, Grieg, Poulenc, Verdi and more, the Moscow Virtuosi bring its characteristic "precision and sharply defined phrases" (*New York Times*) to dazzle Toronto audiences. Tickets are on sale now and can be [purchased here](https://www.roythomsonhall.com/tickets/current/2017/june/vladimir-spivakov-moscow-virtuosi/). The show is **June 8, 2017 at 8PM** at Roy Thomson Hall. This promises to be a beauty of a concert. Get your tickets now and don't miss out.
