Stereotypes exist for a reason, right?

We laughed out loud at [Cassie Kutev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa4MDy7Aqz3Wr3UKmk9SUuw/videos)'s YouTube video, where she "interviews" select members of a choir, from Soprano I to Bass II.

Our favourite quotable quote from the "Tap...water? I want sparkling. I'm a diva. We sparkle."
