title: Two emerging singers to make their Carnegie Hall debut in 2017
---

One of the better ways to kick off a new year: a Carnegie Hall debut.

On **January 17, 2017**, American baritone Benjamin Dickerson and Turkish-Canadian mezzo-soprano Beste Kalender [make their debut at Weill Recital Hall](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2017/1/17/0730/PM/The-Song-Continues-Spotlight-Recital/), as part of The Song Continues: Spotlight Recital series. Founded by famed mezzo Marilyn Horne, The Song Continues is a series of masterclasses and recitals, celebrating emerging young singers "who are about to take the next significant steps in their careers."

For their Carnegie debuts, Dickerson and Kalender will be joined by world-renowned pianist and conductor, Warren Jones. Kalender first met Jones at the Music Academy of the West in 2014; "I performed in a number of projects and he was my main mentor throughout the summer festival," says Kalender. "Our work together for opera scenes, art song and chamber music inspired me in so many ways, and I am delighted to collaborate with this amazing maestro at Carnegie Hall."

Dickerson is also an alumnus of the Music Academy of the West; he and Kalender met during MAW's 2015 production of *La Cenerentola*, the same year that Dickerson won the Marilyn Horne Song Competition. "Benjamin is not only an excellent performer, he has also been a great colleague and friend!"

On the programme are songs by Francesco Santoliquido (which Kalender has "fallen in love with" after hearing them performed by Joyce Di Donato), songs by Berg, Brahms, Liszt, Faur√©, Hahn, Bizet, and Hugo Wolf's *Alte Weisen*, which Jones recommended for Kalender. ("He thought *Alte Weisen von Gottfried Keller* would fit my personality and style.")

Beste Kalender, Benjamin Dickerson, and Warren Jones take the stage at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall on [January 17, 7:30pm](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2017/1/17/0730/PM/The-Song-Continues-Spotlight-Recital/).
