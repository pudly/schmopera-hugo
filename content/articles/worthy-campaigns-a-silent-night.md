Baritone [John Brancy](/scene/people/john-brancy/) and pianist [Peter Dugan](/scene/people/peter-dugan/) have been friends and musical colleagues since 2007, during their shared time at [The Juilliard School](/scene/companies/the-juilliard-school/). Together they have created *A Silent Night: A WWI Centenary Tribute in Song*, a collection of songs written by composers who fought, suffered injuries, and died in the Great War. On the program are works by Butterworth, Ives, Debussy, Poulenc, and Carl Orff. 

"This program honors and illuminates the legacy of these composers, many of whom are often forgotten."

Brancy and Dugan premiered *A Silent Night* at the Kennedy Center, and their subsequent recital tour has included their debut with *Carnegie Hall Presents*. The duo now wish to record *A Silent Night*, and they have launched an [Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-silent-night-a-wwi-centenary-tribute-in-song--2#/) to help the project. Tax-deductible donations will fund album production and post-production, artwork design, marketing, and other costs.

Donations come with [perks](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-silent-night-a-wwi-centenary-tribute-in-song--2#/), too. $5 USD gets you a thank-you video and shout-out from Brancy and Dugan's social media pages, and a $35 USD donation comes with a copy of the album (digital and hard copies), a thank-you video, as well as a signed piano-vocal copy of the pair's exclusive arrangement of *Danny Boy*.

Check out the video below to find out more, and hear some of the stunning music that Brancy and Dugan make together. They hope to start recording this summer, and have the album ready to go for Christmas, 2016. Every little bit helps!
