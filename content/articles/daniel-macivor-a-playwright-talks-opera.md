short_description: 'Playwright and performer Daniel MacIvor is a self-professed opera
  newbie. He’s currently in the process of writing his first libretto for Hadrian,
  the new commission by the Canadian Opera Company, to be set to music by Rufus Wainwright.
  Hadrian is set to open the COC’s 2018/19 season, and so Daniel joined the Against
  the Grain Theatre crew at The Banff Centre to observe rehearsals for #UncleJohn.'

Playwright and performer Daniel MacIvor is a self-professed opera newbie. He's currently in the process of writing his first libretto for [_Hadrian_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Hadrian.aspx), the new commission by the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/Home.aspx), to be set to music by Rufus Wainwright. _Hadrian_ is set to open the COC's 2018/19 season, and so Daniel joined the [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) crew at [The Banff Centre](http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1457) to observe rehearsals for [*#UncleJohn*](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/). He spoke with me about getting to know opera, and about asking the important questions only an unbiased observer can ask. It's fascinating.
