Due to scheduling changes, _#UncleJohn_ has a new star! Baritone [Cameron McPhail](http://www.dispeker.com/artist.php?id=cmcphail) is pretty pumped to put on his Mozart hat and head to the Banff Centre next month. He'll be singing the title role in [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/)'s production of [_#UncleJohn_](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/), in the [Open Space](http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1457) program at the Banff Centre. I caught him in the middle of rehearsals for _La bohème_ in St. John's, Newfoundland, to chat about Don Juan, good intentions, and the artistic mecca that is the Banff Centre.
