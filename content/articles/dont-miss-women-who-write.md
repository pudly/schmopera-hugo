In the midst of a insecure arts climate, the Royal Conservatory of Music is taking International Women's Day to remind us that art, and support for artists, is still happening. On **March 8th, 6:30-7:30pm** at Mazzoleni Hall, the RCM in collaboration with the Canadian Music Centre presents [*Women Who Write*](http://www.rcmusic.ca/music-appreciation), part of their [Music Appreciation](http://www.rcmusic.ca/music-appreciation) events line-up.

Sara Constant, flutist and writer for *Wholenote* leads a round-table dicussion with three Canadian women: [Norma Beecroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Beecroft), pioneer of electronic music composition, [Juliet Palmer](/scene/people/juliet-palmer/), composer and Artistic Director of [Urbavessel](/check-out-urbanvessel/), and Tara Kannangara, Juno-nominated jazz artist and composer. The conversation will "reveal the joys and triumphs of each composer as they find their voices in the Canadian music scene".

Tickets are just $15, and a reception follows the round-table discussion. For more details about *Women Who Write*, **March 8th at 6:30pm**, [click here](http://www.rcmusic.ca/music-appreciation).
