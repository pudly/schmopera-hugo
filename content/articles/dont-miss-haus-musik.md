The night promises a concert "fit for a king", with modular electronic artist [Acote](https://soundcloud.com/acotesound), and the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra playing music by Purcell and even King Henry VIII. Amanda Smith, Artistic Director of [FAWN Chamber Creative](/scene/companies/fawn-chamber-creative/) directs and designs, with choreography by dancer Mary-Dora Bloch-Hansen.
