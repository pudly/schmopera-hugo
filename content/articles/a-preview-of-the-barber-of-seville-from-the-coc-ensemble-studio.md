Yesterday in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, the COC Ensemble Studio gave us a preview of *The Barber of Seville*, in anticipation of their mainstage performance on May 15th. I was so glad I brought my camera; it was a completely fun concert of highlights from Rossini's infamous opera, and it made me pretty excited to see the Ensemble Studio on the big stage.

Here's a quick look from yesterday's preview, featuring [Clarence Frazer](https://twitter.com/clarencefrazer) (Figaro), [Andrew Haji](https://twitter.com/andrewhaji) (Almaviva), [Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure](https://twitter.com/jfortierlazure) (Almaviva), [Charlotte Burrage](https://twitter.com/burragec) (Rosina), Iain MacNeil (Bartolo), [Karine Boucher](https://twitter.com/BoucherKarine) (Berta), and [Jennifer Szeto](https://twitter.com/szetojenn) at the piano.

For full details about the Ensemble Studio performance of *The Barber of Seville*, click [here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx). The word is that the show is officially sold out (way to go, guys!), but I have a feeling there may be some wiggle room if you have friends with connections or don't mind standing-room.
