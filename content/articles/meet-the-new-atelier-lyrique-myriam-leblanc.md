preamble: "The [Atelier lyrique de l'Opéra de Montréal](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/emerging-artists/atelier-lyrique)
  is one of Canada's young artist programmes, where promising young singers get a
  chance to work among professionals as they bridge the gap between school and career.
  The Atelier lyrique, like the Canadian Opera Company's [Ensemble Studio](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company-ensemble-studio/),
  Calgary Opera's [Emerging Artist Development Program](/scene/companies/calgary-opera-emerging-artist-development-program/),
  or Vancouver Opera's [Yulanda M. Faris Young Artist Program](/scene/companies/vancouver-operas-yulanda-m-faris-young-artists-program/),
  hold annual auditions for a small number of coveted spots in their season. \n\nThis
  year, out of 116 singers, the Atelier lyrique welcomes four new singers to the program.
  L'Opéra de Montréal has commissioned former BBC television journalist [Anne Kostalas](https://twitter.com/viewfromalake),
  a self-proclaimed \"opera-obsessive,\" to create a short film introducing each new
  singer. \"The first question I ask the singers is what they like to do when they
  are not singing. I'm trying to create a portrait of them as people, not just singers.
  I'm trying to dispel the myth that opera singers are strange creatures detached
  from ordinary life. Montréal is a wonderful backdrop for any film and I love combining
  images and music.\"\n\nTo learn more about the Atelier lyrique, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLYGVbdy4mg)."

short_description: Soprano Myriam Leblanc is from St. Lazare, outside of Montréal,
  and this is her first season with the Atelier lyrique. She has a background playing
  the violin, and she has studied choral directing, but her love of singing opera
  began with a glance at a score of Puccini&#039;s La bohème. Videographer Anne Kostalas
  followed Myriam on a hike at Mont Saint Bruno, where she likes to spend her time
  when she&#039;s not singing.
