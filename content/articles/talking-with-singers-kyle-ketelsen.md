American bass-baritone [Kyle Ketelsen](http://kyleketelsen.instantencore.com/web/home.aspx) is in Toronto to sing Leporello in Dmitri Tcherniakov's production of [*Don Giovanni*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DonGiovanni.aspx) Don Giovanni, currently at the COC until February 21st. Leporello is a role coveted by most low-voiced men, and Kyle has had the chance to sing the role in close to twenty different productions, including at the Metropolitan Opera, Royal Opera Covent Garden, and the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence. So, I figured he'd be a good person to chat with about the many mysteries in *Don Giovanni*, and about how he balances his full career with his family at home.
