The Canadian Opera Company starts the winter leg of its 2015/16 season, beginning with *Siegfried*, **January 23 to February 14** at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Continuing Wagner's *Ring Cycle* after last season's *Die Walküre*, COC Music Director Johannes Debus returns to the podium, and Canadian François Girard directs a stellar cast that includes [Christine Goerke](/scene/people/christine-goerke/) as Brünnhilde, [Stefan Vinke](/scene/people/stefan-vinke/) as Siegfried, and [Alan Held](/scene/people/alan-held/) as the Wanderer. Hearing more of Goerke's Brünnhilde is enough to convince me that *Siegfried* is not to be missed. Find out more, and grab your tickets [right here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/Siegfried.aspx).

Finally, the COC opens Claus Guth's production of [*Le nozze di Figaro*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/TheMarriageofFigaro.aspx), **February 4 to 27**. Maestro Debus conducts this one as well, an impressive feat for a month's work, no doubt. The cast is exciting: [Josef Wagner](/scene/people/josef-wagner/) and [Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) star as Figaro and his feisty Susanna, and [Erin Wall](/scene/people/erin-wall/) sings opposite [Russell Braun](/scene/people/russell-braun/) as the Countess and Count Almaviva. A few bonus tidbits: on **February 22nd at 7:30pm**, the COC Ensemble Studio members take over the cast of *Figaro* for their annual Ensemble Studio mainstage performance. It's a really exciting night that shows off an extraordinary amount of work by these young artists (not to mention the hype!). Speaking of young artists, the shows on **February 23rd and 25th** will be conducted by [Jordan de Souza](/scene/people/jordan-de-souza/), who's enjoying a bit of a breakout year this season. 

Exciting stuff from the artists, plus it's hard to go wrong with Mozart. For details and tickets, [click right here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/TheMarriageofFigaro.aspx).
