preamble: After all the food is cleared away, the bottles recycled, and once the days
  of the week start to mean something again, it's time to get back to real life. For
  us, real life means going to see lots and lots of shows. It's hard to bundle up
  in the dead of winter and brave the cold for a few hours of music, but we hope to
  convince you of some of our cold weather picks across Canada to kick off 2016.

## *Figaro* and *Siegfried* at the Canadian Opera Company 

The Canadian Opera Company starts the winter leg of its 2015/16 season, beginning with *Siegfried*, **January 23 to February 14** at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Continuing Wagner's *Ring Cycle* after last season's *Die Walküre*, COC Music Director Johannes Debus returns to the podium, and Canadian François Girard directs a stellar cast that includes [Christine Goerke](/scene/people/christine-goerke/) as Brünnhilde, [Stefan Vinke](/scene/people/stefan-vinke/) as Siegfried, and [Alan Held](/scene/people/alan-held/) as the Wanderer. Hearing more of Goerke's Brünnhilde is enough to convince me that *Siegfried* is not to be missed. Find out more, and grab your tickets [right here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/Siegfried.aspx).

Finally, the COC opens Claus Guth's production of [*Le nozze di Figaro*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/TheMarriageofFigaro.aspx), **February 4 to 27**. Maestro Debus conducts this one as well, an impressive feat for a month's work, no doubt. The cast is exciting: [Josef Wagner](/scene/people/josef-wagner/) and [Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) star as Figaro and his feisty Susanna, and [Erin Wall](/scene/people/erin-wall/) sings opposite [Russell Braun](/scene/people/russell-braun/) as the Countess and Count Almaviva. A few bonus tidbits: on **February 22nd at 7:30pm**, the COC Ensemble Studio members take over the cast of *Figaro* for their annual Ensemble Studio mainstage performance. It's a really exciting night that shows off an extraordinary amount of work by these young artists (not to mention the hype!). Speaking of young artists, the shows on **February 23rd and 25th** will be conducted by [Jordan de Souza](/scene/people/jordan-de-souza/), who's enjoying a bit of a breakout year this season. 

Exciting stuff from the artists, plus it's hard to go wrong with Mozart. For details and tickets, [click right here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/TheMarriageofFigaro.aspx).
