short_description: I met composer Kieren MacMillan on a panel for Catherine Kustanczyâ€™s
  CIUT 89.5FM radio show, Hydra, and I thought he was a man of great ideas. Among
  other genres, Kieren writes music theatre and music drama/opera; I was curious about
  the differences in the workshopping process for each. Kieren speaks on the development
  of new opera from his own experience as a composer, and tells us about what stories
  are best set to music.
