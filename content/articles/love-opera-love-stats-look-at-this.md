I made a [pretty neat find](http://opera.wolftrap.org/for-artists/audition-resources/) over at Wolf Trap Opera's website, which has a great section on audition resources. WTO has [collected stats](http://opera.wolftrap.org/for-artists/audition-resources/) on the auditions they've heard over the last four seasons, and which arias are sung the most. 

Organized by voice type, each list shows the number of times an aria appeared on a singer's audition package. They also show which arias were the first offered in an audition.

For [sopranos in 2015](http://opera.wolftrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SOPRANOS-2015.pdf), "Ach, ich fühl's" (*Die Zauberflöte*) made it onto the largest proportion of audition packages; yet the most common start aria was "Je suis encor" (*Manon*). The runner-up in both categories was "Come scoglio" (*Così fan tutte*). 

*Die Zauberflöte* was a popular choice for this year's auditions, it seems. [Tenors](http://opera.wolftrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/TENORS-2015.pdf) sang lots of "Dies Bildnis," and "O Isis" was the top choice for [basses](http://opera.wolftrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BASSES-2015.pdf). [Baritones](http://opera.wolftrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BARITONES-2015.pdf) and [mezzos](http://opera.wolftrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MEZZOS-2015.pdf) didn't stray far, offering up lots of the Count's aria and "Smanie implacabili" from *Così*.

I don't know about you, but I love this kind of stuff. To peruse, start [right here](http://opera.wolftrap.org/for-artists/audition-resources/).
