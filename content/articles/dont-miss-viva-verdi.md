## What do you love best about Verdi's music?

**Sabatino Vacca**: Everything! What's not to love? He was a master at marrying text to music, converting textual feelings and motives into passionate music!

**Renée Salewski**: I love that his music is accessible, and yet it remains interesting.

**Stacie Carmona**: I love how Verdi's music is full of contrast.  He writes grand moments that envelop the listener, like the Triumphal March in *Aida*, or the "Rex Tremendae" in the *Requiem Mass*. Then, his music can also be full of tenderness and vulnerability, for example: "Dio mi potevi scagliar" from *Otello*.

**Kristine Dandavino**: Verdi gets my voice. Unlike Puccini, Verdi wrote several fantastic roles for the dramatic mezzo-soprano voice, strong women that get to sing beautiful arias. That is my kind of man.

**Michael York**: The best thing about Verdi's music is his directness. Even in his later more complex works, there's always a straight line of what's in the heart of a character; an aria or a scene with little ambiguity yet with a great amount of complexity.

## If you could describe Verdi's operas in one word, what would it be?

**Kristine**: Visceral.

**Sabatino**: Heroic!

**Renée**: Addictive.

**Stacie and Michael**: Human.
