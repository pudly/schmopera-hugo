short_description: This morning, Peter Oundjian announced the Toronto Symphony Orchestra&#039;s
  2015/16 season. It looks creative and diverse, and there are more than a few items
  on the menu I can&#039;t wait to see. One of them is The Decades Project, a collection
  of six concert programmes featuring music from 1900-1909 (Oct. 21-Nov. 14, 2015),
  and 1910-1919 (May 25-Jun. 11, 2016).

It looks creative and diverse, and there are more than a few items on the menu I can't wait to see. One of them is&nbsp;<em>The Decades Project</em>, a collection of six concert programmes featuring music from 1900-1909 (Oct. 21-Nov. 14, 2015), and 1910-1919 (May 25-Jun. 11, 2016). Since I'm a big fan of singers, and I know you are too, I've compiled a short, singer-centric list of the TSO's 2015/16 season. <a href="http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/Media-Room/Media-Releases.aspx?entryID=42430" target="_blank">Click here for the full announcement</a> and start marking your calendars (like September 24th, when Itzhak Perlman comes to town for the TSO's Opening Night Gala) .</p><p>On October 7 and 8, 2015, soprano <a href="http://www.barbarahannigan.com/" target="_blank">Barbara Hannigan</a> will make her Canadian conducting debut, leading a programme of Mozart, Haydn, and Ligeti.
