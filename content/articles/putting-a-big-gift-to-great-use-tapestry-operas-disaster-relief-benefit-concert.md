This coming Wednesday, **October 25**, Tapestry Opera presents two concerts in one night, both sending proceeds towards the disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico, Dominica, Mexico, and India, and the work being done by Medecins san Frontieres and Global Medic.

The two concerts are timely, as well as a great use for Tapestry Opera's recent gift: a 9.5-foot Imperial Bösendorfer 290 concert grand piano, donated generously by Clarence Byrd and Ida Chen. If you've ever been to Tapestry's Ernest Balmer Studio, you know that it's on the third floor, and that the stairwells would be a fairly tight fit for the delivery of a full-sized grand; instead, it was installed with the help of a crane:
