November is a great month for the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/companies/toronto-symphony-orchestra/), and I figured I'd share a couple of my picks for the coming weeks.

This week, on November 12th and 14th, the TSO's ongoing [Decades Project](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/The-Decades-Project.aspx) continues with a programme of music written between 1900-1909. Maestro Michael Sanderling conducts the orchestra, joined by soprano [Simone Osborne](/talking-with-singers-simone-osborne/) for Mahler's 4th, his "gentlest symphony." Simone will also treat us to two turn-of-the-century arias from Charpentier's *Louise* and Dvořák's *Rusalka*. Sounds pretty divine to me. For details and tickets, [click here](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/Mahler-Symphony-4.aspx).

On November 20th and 21st, get your Bond on with [*James Bond: The Music*](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/James-Bond-The-Music.aspx). The TSO and vocalists [Capathia Jenkins](http://capathiajenkins.com/about/) (Broadway's *The Civil War*, Off-Broadway's *Godspell*) and [Ron Bohmer](http://www.ronbohmer.com/) (currently touring *The Book of Mormon*) offer up Bond hits like *Goldfinger*, *Live and Let Die*, and *Skyfall*. John Morris Russell conducts. For details and tickets, [click here](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/James-Bond-The-Music.aspx).

Finally, on November 26th, the TSO presents [*Peter and the Wolf: In Support of SickKids*](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/Peter-and-the-Wolf-In-Support-of-SickKids.aspx). In a benefit for Toronto's [major paediatric hospital](http://www.sickkids.ca/), special guest Rick Mercer narrates an evening of family-friendly classical faves, like Benjamin Britten's *The Young People's Guide to the Orchestra* and Prokofiev's *Peter and the Wolf*. Peter Oundjian conducts and co-hosts. For details and tickets, [click here](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/Peter-and-the-Wolf-In-Support-of-SickKids.aspx). Here's a little preview from Mr. Mercer himself:
