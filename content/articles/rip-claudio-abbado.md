Italian conductor [Claudio Abbado has died at age 80](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/10583578/Claudio-Abbado-Italian-conductor-dies-aged-80.html), after a long battle with stomach cancer. Born in Milan, Abbado made his debut at La Scala in 1960, and served as its music director from 1968-1986\. After that, he became the music director of the Vienna State Opera until 1991\. I've included what I think is an apt look back at the great maestro Abbado: his conducting of the Prelude to Verdi's _Macbeth_, La Scala, 1975.
