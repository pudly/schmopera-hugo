## Can you describe a day in the life of an apprentice singer at Santa Fe Opera?

Life as an apprentice singer at Santa Fe Opera is electric. Always busy and constantly learning, you can expect your daily schedule to consist of various opera rehearsals, cover assignments, coachings, concert gigs, scenes assignments, and wig/costume fittings.  

## What appealed to you about the apprentice program?

Santa Fe Opera has a reputation for presenting world class opera. Its apprentice singer program has helped cultivate some of the most respected artists in the business. Being at Santa Fe opera you are simply surrounded by the best and the expectation is that you will be your best. It's a wonderful place to grow and hone your craft. 

## What do you think is an important part of being a good understudy?

To be a good understudy you must show up day one as if you were going to be singing and staging all the rehearsals. Preparation before your arrival and focus once you are observing are crucial to understudying a role. It's a real treat to understudy at Santa Fe Opera because you actually get to perform a "cover run" of the role. It gives you an opportunity to sing through and perform the role and it ensures the company you could go on if it were necessary. 

## How have you been spending your free time outside of rehearsals?

I am lucky enough to have my husband and two dogs with me all summer. When I am not at rehearsal I am spending time walking my dogs, grilling with friends and neighbors, and generally soaking in the beauty of Santa Fe. 

## Are there any highlights of the summer you're particularly looking forward to?

I am fortunate enough this season to be singing the role of Chrisann Brennan in *The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs* and will be making my company debut in a world premiere! I love the piece and I am so grateful to be part of it.
