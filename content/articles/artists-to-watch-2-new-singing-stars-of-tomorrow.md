Hello Schmop-Tops!

On a cool, almost cold Saturday night I made my way over to the Spadina Theatre of the Alliance Française to check out the culmination recital organized by the International Resource Centre for Performing Artists. 

The recital was highlighted by the selection of a developing artist, who will receive a "Career Blueprint." The artist will travel to New York and work for 3 days at the National Opera Centre of America, where they'll have recordings, auditions, and press kits done - a DEFINITE boon for an up-and-coming artist. 

The evening was a delight, mostly *bel canto* material as they all had the wonderful opportunity to work with superstar [Sondra "La Wowza" Radvanovsky](/review-sondra-slays-in-bellini-masterwork/). Who better? #AmIRight 

The ten singers were all polished and ready to go in this intimate venue, and didn't seem fazed in the slightest by the clear visibility of the audience. I don't have the space to talk about every singer, but some of the highlights of the evening are definitely worth mentioning. 

Mezzo-soprano [Marjorie Maltais](/spotlight-on-marjorie-maltais/) came out with guns blazing to open the show with a beautiful aria from *La Cenerentola*. Her ease with coloratura throughout her remarkable range is something that is a wonder to behold, and also something I'm glad I get to see develop. This young lady is going to take the world by storm.

Soprano [Beth Hagerman](/spotlight-on-beth-hagerman/), offering up the only Puccini of the night, brought her stunning brilliance of tone and (still) growing vocal size to "Un bel dì vedremo" from *Madama Butterfly*. Soprano 

[Danielle MacMillan](/spotlight-on-danielle-macmillan/) was also a standout for me. I felt she may have been one of the more developed ladies on the program. Her production was visceral and her tone ethereal - it was an enthralling balance to achieve. Soprano [Natalya Gennadi](http://www.schmopera.com/scene/people/natalya-matyusheva/) brought us an Anna Bolena that was nuanced, and beautifully delivered. Tenor [Asitha Tennekoon](/scene/people/asitha-tennekoon/) absolutely destroyed an aria from *La fille du régiment* (Yes... he NAILED all the high Cs). Other highlights were soprano [Sara Schabas](/scene/people/sara-schabas/) and soprano [Caitlin Wood](/scene/people/caitlin-wood/).

At the end of the evening, we learned that after their intensive work with Radvanovsky, "La Wowza" couldn't decide which singer should be awarded the Career Blueprint - so they decided to send TWO singers. The winners of the evening were Marjorie Maltais and Natalya Gennadi. 

Congratulations, ladies! We can't wait to see you conquer the world's stages!
