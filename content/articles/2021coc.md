There's beauty in the Canadian Opera Company's [freshly-announced 2020-21 season](https://www.coc.ca/season-listing-page). It's symmetrical; there are three revivals - pretty recent-history ones, too - and three Interesting Productions. Of course, there are interesting things about each production, but the three new items on the season line-up have a special sort of intrigue.

The fall starts off with what's probably the most Interesting of them all: Richard Wagner's _Parsifal_ (Sept. 25-Oct. 18, 2020). **François Girard** directs, **Michael Levine** designs (#gocanada), and it's going to be huge - literally. The orchestra (conducted by COC Music Diretor **Johannes Debus**) will be twice its usual size, a cast of more than 100, and the opera will last nearly six hours - very hardcore. **Christopher Ventris** sings the title role, alongside **Johan Reuter** as Amfortas and **Tanja Ariane Baumgartner** as Kundry. I remember Reuter well from the COC's _Die Walküre_, but I've not yet heard Ventris or Baumgartner live. Frankly, a _Parsifal_ casting is something I'd gladly leave in the hands of Alexander Neef, the COC's General Director for one more season.

The next biggie is also a rarity in Canada: Leoš Janáček's _Katya Kabanova_ (February 6-20, 2021). The production is by **David Alden**, and **Johannes Debus** conducts; one can safely anticipate bleakness onstage, but that seems fitting for this desolate version of a psychological thriller. I don't know this opera at all, really, but I'm completely curious. Janáček's music is stunning (_Jenůfa_, anyone?) and this _Katya Kabanova_ will mark the COC debut of American soprano **Amanda Majeski** in the title role. She's fab, I'm excited. Also, **Susan Bullock**! **Alain Coulombe**!

> I'm sort of baffled by this _La traviata_ happening in the spring, though.

Finally, I can't wait to see the dense drama of Gluck's _Orfeo ed Euridice_ (May 1-15, 2021). It's the stark, striking production by **Robert Carsen**, conducted by **Bernard Labadie**. Three great singers making up the compact cast: **Iestyn Davies** as Orfeo, **Anna-Sophie Neher** as Euridice, and **Mireille Asselin** as Amore. Perfect. I love this opera because it's the opposite of indulgent, very straightforward and ahead of its time. It's one of those operas where taking away one scene or one line would make the whole thing crumble.

Interspersed with the Interesting Productions are three revived productions, all of which seem like they haven't yet had enough distance from the COC stage to be properly missed. Claus Guth's _Le nozze di Figaro_ is back, Oct. 20-Nov. 7, 2020; this is the one where Cherubino has a strange twin who doesn't sing but is also Cupid. Not terrible, but definitely German. The singing should be good, with **Josef Wagner** returning to sing Figaro, and **Emily D'Angelo** as Cherubino.

That _Carmen_ is back, too, Jan. 23-Feb. 21, 2021. It's the production adopted by **Joel Ivany**, and **Johannes Debus** will conduct. I'm surprised it's back so soon (it was only just at the COC in 2016), but it must be a sure-thing hit. In this revival, it's also a vehicle for great young talent, like **J'nai Bridges** as Carmen and **Michael Fabiano** as Don José. Pretty great.

> Anyway. I'm excited for _Parsifal_.

I'm sort of baffled by this _La traviata_ happening in the spring, though (Apr. 17-May 16, 2021). I do love a _Traviata_, and I don't hate this production by Arin Arbus. But it's a weird flex for the COC to have **Sondra Radvanovsky** sing Violetta, **Joseph Calleja** as Alfredo, and **Artur Ruciński** as Germont. I almost don't want them in these roles; they're maybe too old, and there's a big risk of opera-by-numbers, where seasoned pros phone it in with standards like _Traviata_ (not all seasoned pros, of course). If you're opting to see it, I'd even suggest checking out one of the two final performances (May 6 and 16), where Violetta is sung by up-and-comer **Vanessa Vasquez**.

Also, the COC _very quietly_ added that **Stephen Lord** will be conducting this _Traviata_. This opera is certainly in Lord's sweet spot of conducting style, so it makes sense... except for the unsavoury fact that last year Lord was faced with "more than two dozen" allegations of sexual harassment, and he subsequently left his positions at Opera Theatre of St. Louis and Michigan Opera Theatre. I don't actually know what that means for this job. He'll conduct it like a dream... but it does feel icky that the COC obviously had him ready for this contract when the allegations happened, didn't replace him, and then just casually went all, <sup>**_Oh, and Stephen Lord is conducting, don't worry about it..._**</sup>

Anyway. I'm excited for _Parsifal_.
