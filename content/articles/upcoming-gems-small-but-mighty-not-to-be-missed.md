This spring, opera fans in Toronto can expect some lighter fare to go with the warming weather.

On **May 1, 7pm** at Lula Lounge (1585 Dundas St. W), check out the latest from Tongue in Cheek Productions: [_Democracy in Action_](https://www.tongueincheekproductions.com/democracyinaction). Though the title feels timely, the political stakes aren't costly with this night of singing. The audience holds the power here - with the help of online polls, and a "wide array of eclectic selections", listeners can cast their vote and hear the results.

For [_Democracy in Action_](https://www.tongueincheekproductions.com/democracyinaction), TiC has gathered a solid line-up of Canadian talent, including [Teiya Kasahara](/scene/people/teiya-kasahara/), [Krisztina Szabó](/scene/people/krisztina-szab/) and [Julie Nesrallah](/scene/people/julie-nesrallah/). At the piano is Trevor Chartrand.

Doors open at 6:30, and the show begins at 7pm. Tickets start at $25, and seating is guaranteed with a dinner reservation. Find out more by calling Lula Lounge at (416) 588-0307.

And on **June 27, 8pm** at Merchants of Green Coffee (2 Matilda Street), the women of [Muse 9 Productions](https://www.facebook.com/Muse9Productions/) put up _Bon Appetit! A Musical Tasting Menu_. The delicious-looking programme is named for Lee Hoiby's ingenious _Bon Appetit!_, which essentially turns an episode of Julia Child's _The French Chef_ into a mini-opera.

You'll also hear soprano/composer [Danika Lorèn](/scene/people/danika-lorèn/)'s curiously titled _The Secret Lives of Vegetables_, and in a guarantee for laughs, the song cycle by Toronto favourite Peter Tiefenbach, _Chansons de mon placard_.

[Anna Theodosakis](/scene/people/anna-theodosakis/) directs, and [Hyejin Kwon](/scene/people/hyejin-kwon/) is at the piano.

Tickets start at $25, and can be [purchased right here](https://muse9food.brownpapertickets.com/). And as a bonus, the _Musical Tasting Menu_ will head to London, ON, **June 29th and 30th** at the Covent Garden Market Kitchen, in partnership with Village Opera.
