<p class="intro">
	Readers, listen up! This coming Wednesday, January 21st, I get to join arts writer <a href="https://twitter.com/catekustanczy" target="_blank">Catherine Kustanczy</a> (<em>Hyperallergic</em>, <em>xoJane</em>, <em>Opera News</em>) on her brand new radio show, <em>Hydra</em>.<br>
</p>
<p>
	The topic? <em>Don Giovanni</em>: we love to hate the Don, and opera companies love to put up Mozart's "perfect" tale of history's most ubiquitous womanizer. In the midst of today's tangled cluster of opinions about gender and sexuality, what does a story like <em>Don Giovanni</em> tell us? Is he a sex addict? An abuser? Misunderstood? Are his women victims? Or crying wolf?
</p>
<p>
	Also part of the discussion panel is baritone <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron_mcphail" target="_blank">Cameron McPhail</a>, no stranger to The Don (<a href="/unclejohn-the-toronto-story/" target="_blank"><em>#UncleJohn</em></a>, anyone?). There may be more guests, and you'll have to listen to find out who.
</p>
<p>
	You can hear us on <a href="http://www.ciut.fm/listen-now/" target="_blank">CIUT 89.5FM, Wednesday at 9:40am</a>, either by tuning in, or listening via <a href="http://128.100.197.46/listen.pls" target="_blank">iTunes right here</a>.
