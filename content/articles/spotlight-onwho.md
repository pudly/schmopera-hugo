Readers, you're big fans of our ["Spotlight On..."](/spotlight-on-stephanie-tritchew/) series, where we post a set list of questions to singers, pianists, conductors, and directors, to figure out why and how they do what they do.

We've got our own ongoing wish-list of artists we'd love to interview, and we have a hunch that you know some folks you'd like to see featured on Schmopera. 

If you know an artist - even better, an up-and-coming artist - with some wise words to share about the opera life, please introduce us! You can email us at [hello@schmopera.com](mailto:hello@schmopera.com), and let us know a bit about what they're up to.

And yes, you can definitely vouch for yourself!
