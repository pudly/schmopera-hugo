Ok, so a friend of mine showed me this video:
It's absolutely Colin Mochrie lip-syncing to the voice of Russell Braun in a clip from _Burnt Toast_, an eight-part coming opera made for television 2006 (CBC, _Bravo!_). The music is by Alexina Louie, with text by Dan Redican, and the series features [some of Canada's best voices](http://burnttoastopera.com/credits.html), including Isabel Bayrakdarian, Krisztina Szabó, Peter McGillivray, Jean Stilwell and Benjamin Butterfield. Find out all about it [here](http://www.burnttoastopera.com/about/).

Also on burnttoastopera.com: [Operagrams](http://burnttoastopera.com/operagrams/)! These are ridiculous. For $4.00, you can send someone a recording of either a man or woman singing famous operatic tunes, with different words, appropriate for various occasions. There's the Habanera for the Booty Call Operagram, or the Ride of the Valkyries for a Drunk Dial, or "Largo al factotum" for an I'm Sorry. They're hilarious; you can preview the recordings right [here](http://burnttoastopera.com/operagrams/).

So, a double-whammy over at burnttoastopera.com. Not bad for a Sunday.
