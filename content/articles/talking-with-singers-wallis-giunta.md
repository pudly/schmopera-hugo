Canadian mezzo-soprano [Wallis Giunta](/scene/people/wallis-giunta/) spoke to us from St. Louis, between performances of Angelina in *La Cenerentola* and Rossweise in *Die Walküre*, both at [Oper Leipzig](http://www.oper-leipzig.de/en/programm/person/wallis-giunta/8537). She's also getting ready to sing Mercédès in [Oper Frankfurt](http://www.oper-frankfurt.de/de/spielplan/carmen/?id_datum=8#date)'s *Carmen* in July, before returning to Toronto for the title role in Purcell's [*Dido and Aeneas*](http://operaatelier.com/season/16-17-season/) at [Opera Atelier](/scene/people/opera-atelier/) in October.

We asked her about advice for North American singers working in Germany, about getting her fix of feminine roles among a résumé full of trouser roles, and the items she always keeps in her suitcase while she's on the road.
