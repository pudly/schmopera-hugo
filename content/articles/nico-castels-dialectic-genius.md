On May 31st, the opera world lost comprimario tenor and linguistic authority, [Nico Castel](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/arts/music/nico-castel-tenor-and-diction-coach-at-the-met-dies-at-83.html?_r=0). I never personally had the chance to work with Castel, but I'm among the many who thanked him every day for his *Complete Opera Libretti Translation Series*, the invaluable anthologies of opera libretti, translated and phoneticized.

We know him as a language perfectionist, but he never lacked a sense of humour. Here's a melding of the two, where Castel recites the Haushofmeister's monologue from Strauss' *Ariadne auf Naxos*, one of his signatures roles. All in German, he recites the monologue à-la-American, Puerto Rican, French, Russian, Japanese...absolutely worth a watch.
