Looking for something to catch this weekend in Toronto? [Head to Roy Thomson Hall](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/William-Tell-Turin-Royal-Theatre.aspx) to hear some Rossini. On Friday, December 5th, the TSO brings the [Turin Royal Theatre](http://www.teatroregio.torino.it/en/node/4163/locandina)'s Orchestra and Chorus, led&nbsp;by guest conductor [Gianandrea Noseda](http://www.gianandreanoseda.com/home.aspx), for an in-concert performance of *William Tell*. I have to miss this one, and I'm sorry to miss the chance to hear soprano Angela Meade sing the role of Mathilde. Angela has been impressing me for a few years now, and Toronto isn't a common stop for her. In the title role is baritone [*Luca Salsi*](https://twitter.com/rigoletto75), with tenor Enea Scala</a> as Arnold, and basses Marco Spotti and Fabrizio Beggi as Walter and Melchthal.

So go, go see this and tell me how it was! The performance starts at 7pm this Friday at Roy Thomson Hall. For more details and to buy tickets (starting at $33) [click here](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/William-Tell-Turin-Royal-Theatre.aspx).
