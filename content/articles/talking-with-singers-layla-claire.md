Canadian soprano [Layla Claire](/scene/people/layla-claire/) is no stranger to Mozart's operas. Her singing of Mozart's roles are award-winning (Prix des Amis d’Aix-en-Provence, Wilhelm Stenhammar International Competition Mozart Prize); she has appeared as the Countess (*Le nozze di Figaro*), Donna Anna (*Don Giovanni*), and Fiordiligi (*Così fan tutte*), and in the 2016/17 season she returns to the [Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/) to sing Pamina in *The Magic Flute*.

Claire makes her debut at the Salzburg Festival this summer, singing Donna Elvira in [*Don Giovanni*](http://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/opera/don-giovanni-2016), and she's part of a stellar cast, including Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (Giovanni) and [Luca Pisaroni](/talking-with-singers-luca-pisaroni/) (Leporello). With the help of the kind folks in Salzburg, we were able to chat with Claire about the dream of singing Mozart in his birth-city, and how a cast of Italians helps her raise the bar with all those recits.

For details and ticket information for *Don Giovanni*, running August 4-21, [click here](http://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/opera/don-giovanni-2016).
