The Dallas Opera has created a new residential program, the [Institute for Women Conductors](http://dallasopera.org/learn/womens-conducting-institute/). "This program has already generated tremendous international interest, and over extremely 100 talented women applied -- from the U.S. and 26 other countries. The field was extremely competitive, and the acceptance on the program is recognition of the significant accomplishments in the candidate’s career to date."

The Dallas Opera has announced the participants for the program, which include 6 young conductors and four observers:

- [Jennifer Condon](/scene/people/jennifer-condon/)
- [Jessica Gethin](/scene/people/jessica-gethin)
- [Natalie Murray](/scene/people/natalie-murray-beale/)
- [Stephanie Rhodes](/scene/people/stephanie-rhodes/)
- [Anna Skryleva](/scene/people/anna-skryleva/)
- [Lidiya Yankovskaya](/scene/people/lidiya-yankovskaya/)

- [Lucik Aprahamian](/scene/people/lucik-aprahamian/) (observing)

Find out more about the Institute for Women Conductors in our [interview with Keith Cerny](/fostering-maestras-the-institute-for-women-conductors-at-the-dallas-opera/), General Director and CEO of The Dallas Opera, who answered my questions about why programs like this are timely and important.
