Canadian soprano and pianist [Rachel Fenlon](/scene/people/rachel-fenlon/) is redefining what it means to curate one's own recital.

Fenlon has compiled selected songs of Franz Schubert's, into a cycle she has dubbed [*Liebesbotschaft*](http://gallery345.com/performances.php#june17); she'll not only sing, but accompany herself at the piano.

It's an extremely personal way of presenting music of the traditional recital canon; with *Liebesbotschaft*, Fenlon shows audiences not only what she feels about Schubert's songs, but distills her interpretation of the voice and piano parts into a singular source. The cycle is compiled to evoke "striking poetic and harmonic expedition", and the autonomy she earns by self-accompaniment offers "a spontaneous, relevant, and impromptu feeling" to well-loved music.

Fenlon will tour *Liebesbotschaft* through London, Paris, Berlin and Oslo, and she'll first offer a preview performance in Toronto. You can hear her on **June 17, at 8pm** at Gallery 345, 345 Sorauren Ave. Tickets start at $20, and they're available [right here](http://gallery345.com/performances.php#june17).
