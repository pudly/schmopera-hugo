## Why do you sing professionally?

I ask myself this question all the time! No, seriously,	I can't	imagine	doing anything else. The opera bug gets	a hold of you, and there's no turning back.	I love the music, I love performing, I love	traveling and experiencing different cultures, I love meeting and working with new colleagues.

## What do you enjoy about portraying Richard Nixon? What do you find challenging about	the	role?

At the moment,	I'm	enjoying the spontaneity within	each and every performance. As a cast, we're growing more and more comfortable with the	piece, andÂ we're constantly	trying to find new colors and fresh	motivation for each	and	every scene.

The	most challenging aspect	of the role	is to try and remain musically accurate while trying to	be dramatically	convincing.	This is	normally the case anyway, but even more so with Nixon. Rhythmically	speaking, it's a tricky	piece, so we always	need to	keep an	eye	on the conductor.

## Why do you think that many young artists find it more difficult to sing in English?

I have no idea.	Each language has its own set of special challenges for each particular individual.	We all have to keep studying and working through these challenges over the duration	of our careers. Thankfully, I've always	felt comfortable singing in	my native tongue.

## Are there roles you've performed	with which you have a particular connection?

Yes, there's one in particular,	and	that's Posa	in Verdi's *Don Carlo*. His	ambition to	do	the	right thing, his fearlessness, his resolve...	Yeah, Posa is my guy.

## What	do you wish you knew about singing 10 years ago?

This is a very good	question. Firstly, my current self would tell my younger self to keep studying voice on	a consistent basis.	This is	difficult because we travel	so much	and	we're away from	home for weeks and months at a time. Regardless, it's important	to make time for touching base with your voice teacher and/or vocal	coach.
