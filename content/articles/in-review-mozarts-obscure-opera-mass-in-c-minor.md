	Thursday night was the first of three concerts to be given by the <a href="http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/Mozart-Mass-in-C-Minor.aspx" target="_blank">Toronto Symphony Orchestra</a>, programming Mozart's fantastic Mass in C Minor, K. 427, with fragments of two of his lesser-known operas, <em>Lo sposo deluso </em>and <em>Zaide</em> (K. 430 and 344, respectively).<em> </em><a href="http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/conductors/paul-goodwin" target="_blank">Paul Goodwin</a> conducts the TSO, both the <a href="http://www.amadeuschoir.com/" target="_blank">Amadeus Choir</a> and the <a href="http://www.elmeriselersingers.com/" target="_blank">Elmer Iseler Singers</a>, as well as the evening's line up of formidable singers: soprano <a href="http://www.fr-lebureau.com/fiche_artiste.php?id=9" target="_blank">Hélène Guilmette</a>, mezzo <a href="http://imgartists.com/artist/julie_boulianne" target="_blank">Julie Boulianne</a>, tenors <a href="http://www.johnptessier.com/" target="_blank">John Tessier</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jfortierlazure" target="_blank">Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure</a>, and baritone <a href="http://www.ariamanagement.com/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/" target="_blank">Gordon Bintner</a>.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	The TSO started the night off with the overture to <em>Lo sposo. </em>They played so transparently, never letting loud moments linger and become a wash of sound. The scenes from <em>Lo sposo deluso,</em> or <em>The Disappointed Bridegroom</em>, were the only finished sections of the abandoned opera. The opera felt like a mix of <em>La serva padrona</em> and <em>Don Pasquale</em>, with a blustering baritone who buys himself a bride, and a few overlapping love triangles between his intended bride, his marriage broker and his niece.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	Gordon Bintner was spectacular as Bocconio, the groom-to-be. He sang with enormous energy, despite how unforgivingly high the role seemed. He seemed an expert on switching up between his cannon of a full voice to funny patter that imitated a plucked double bass. As the unwilling bride-to-be, Eugenia, Julie Boulianne showed a beautifully rich and warm sound, negotiating huge leaps and clear-as-a-bell coloratura. Her aria sounded to me like a combo of Fiordiligi and Konstanze; very cool, didn't sound easy to sing.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	Tenor John Tessier sang Don Asdrubale's aria, in which he sells the sham marriage as something to be desired. Tessier sang it well with a that reedy, open sound you want in Don Ottavio and Tamino. I had expected a bit more Dr. Malatesta in this aria, but I don't know the score or text, beyond the translations provided. The final ensemble number brought in soprano Hélène Guilmette and Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure, and it was fascinating to hear a precursor of the Act II <i>Figaro </i>finale.

<p style="text-align: left;">
	The <em>Zaide </em>excerpts were lovely to hear. I admit to only being really familiar with Zaide's aria, "Ruhe sanft", which is still a popular choice for sopranos. But it's so beautiful, this music. John Tessier sang Gomatz's aria, which had real suggestions of Belmonte from <em>Die Entführung</em> and Tito's arias in <em>La clemenza di Tito</em>. Hélène Guilmette sang Zaide with agility and lightness, and I was dying to hear more. The final trio included Gordon Bintner, as Allazin, who again sounded <em>fantastic</em>. The writing of the trio was similar to the ensembles in <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>, once again piquing the nerdier side of me.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	It was amazing to hear these unfinished pieces of Mozart's work. The Mozartness is always there, with beautifully symmetrical phrases and transparent lines; but I noticed a few awkward endings, too-thick orchestration, and lines for the singers that weren't <em>quite </em>organic to the language (or the limits of human lung capacity). This is one of those concerts I wish I could hear with new ears, so I weren't always inclined to compare new Mozart (for me) to familiar Mozart.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	The second half of the concert featured the sections of the Mass in C Minor that were completed by Mozart himself. The Mass was where the women stood out, I thought. Julie Boulianne sang the well-known "Laudamus te", with such stillness it was thrilling. It's a difficult sing, and Julie had already showed us that "mezzo-soprano" is simply a word, with her enormous and easy range. It was a wonderful thing to see a singer so calm and grounded, delivering clean and exciting singing. She also didn't bring her music up with her for this aria; performance practice (and perceived blasphemy) aside, it added to the show of it all. Gorgeous dress, too. Hélène Guilmette did most of her work in the Mass, sounding bell-like and florid in her aria, including an extended and exposed cadenza at the end. The "Domine" was a duet with Hélène and Julie, and the two of them couldn't have blended better. The final Benedictus was thrilling, finally welcoming back Gordon Bintner to fill out the beautiful ensemble.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	The Amadeus Choir and the Elmer Iseler Singers sounded clean and powerful, and the TSO, as expected, continued the night with seasoned Mozart playing. It's a great night of music, even if you don't nerd out on the Mozart, obscure and famous. The concert reprises tomorrow night, January 24th at 7:30pm at Roy Thomson Hall, and Sunday January 25th at 3pm, at the George Weston Recital Hall. <a href="http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/Mozart-Mass-in-C-Minor.aspx" target="_blank">Click here for tickets and details</a>.
