I was perusing the opera corner of Reddit (r/opera) and came across a [fantastic post](http://www.reddit.com/r/opera/comments/3168tw/opera_about_elephants_ears/) by a user who needed help in naming that opera tune that he/she had just heard. 

"I just heard some opera on a classical radio station. Dun dun dun duuuuh du dun Elephant's ears Dun dun dun duuuuh du dun EEE-Eh-EhEEEEEEELEPHANT'S EARS.  
At least that's what it sounds like. What is this song, and what is he really singing about?" 

I was so excited to share it with you all, and ask for your help in identifying the mysterious aria. Because I had zero idea. Minutes ago, the user updated the post, making me smile even bigger: 

"EDIT: found it! 0:20 for "elephants earhole", 0:44 for "elephants ear,EEE-Eh-EhEEEEEEELEPHANT'S EARS" So what is he really singing about?" 

The user included this link:

"E di pensier," "Elephant's ear," I'll buy it. I love the Internet.
