Recently I joined hosts Kathleen Kajioka and Jeff Melanson (President and CEO of the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/companies/toronto-symphony-orchestra/)) and fellow guest Michael Vincent (editor, [*Musical Toronto*](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/mt-staff-and-writers/)) for a somewhat meta-conversation about the value of music criticism, and what comes with the increase in independent blogs (like this one!). Also on this week's show: Melanson chats with TSO concertmaster [Jonathan Crow](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/About-the-TSO/Members-of-the-Orchestra/Musician/Jonathan-Crow.aspx), Kajioka points out what to listen for in [Mahler's 4th Symphony](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/Mahler-Symphony-4.aspx) (featuring soprano [Simone Osborne](/scene/people/simone-osborne/)), and they both discuss this fall's [Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra concert](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2015-2016-Season/EventDetails/Toronto-Symphony-Youth-Orchestra-Fall-Concert.aspx) (November 15th).
