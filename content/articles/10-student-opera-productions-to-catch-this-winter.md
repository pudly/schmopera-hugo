From **February 20 to 27** at the Helen Corning Warner Theater, AVA presents Massenet's stunning [*Werther*](http://www.avaopera.org/productions/2015/werther/).  Luke Housner is the orchestra for all four performances, making this an exciting chance to hear young singers in what may be considered "stretch roles".
