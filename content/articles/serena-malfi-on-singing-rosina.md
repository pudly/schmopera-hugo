Italian mezzo-soprano [Serena Malfi](http://www.serenamalfi.com/) has been in Toronto for the last month (enjoying the weather, I'm sure), preparing to sing Rosina with the Canadian Opera Company, in [Els Comediants'](http://comediants.com/?page_id=85&lang=en) production of *The Barber of Seville* ([opening this Friday night](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville.aspx)). She was delightful to chat with; I asked her a bit about singing the role of Rosina, and the fun of switching from trouser roles into dresses. 

*The Barber of Seville* plays for 13 performances until May 22nd; Serena Malfi shares the role of Rosina with American mezzo [Cecelia Hall](http://ceceliahall.com/). [Click here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville.aspx) for full details.
