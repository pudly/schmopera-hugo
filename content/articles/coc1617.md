  Last night, the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/) announced their 2016/17 season in style, with the COC Orchestra on the Four Seasons Centre Stage. Brent Bambury, of CBC Radio One, hosted the night, chatting with COC General Director Alexander Neef and Music Director Johannes Debus about the exciting season to come.

  We were treated to performances by the COC Orchestra with Jane Archibald, Andrew Haji, and Christine Goerke. They offered arias from the season to come, and did well on the tempting; Goerke brought down the house with her closing number, "Ortrud's Curse" from  *Lohengrin*, which reminded me how much I'm looking forward to seeing *Siegfried* (opens January 23!)

  Without further ado, have a look at the COC's 2016/17 line-up:

## *Norma*

Fall 2016 kicks off with a bang, with maestro **Stephen Lord** and director **Kevin Newbury** heading the creative team for Bellini's *Norma*. Star soprano [**Sondra Radvanovsky**](/scene/people/sondra-radvanovsky/) shares the title role with South African soprano **Elza van den Heever**. That's a double shot of excellent singing; both women have wowed COC audiences in the past, Sondra as Queen Elizabeth I in *Roberto Devereux* and Elza as Leonora in *Il trovatore*. Tenor **Russell Thomas** (of the COC's *Les contes d'Hoffmann*) sings Pollione, Norma's lover, and mezzo-soprano [**Isabel Leonard**](/scene/people/isabel-leonard/) (of *La clemenza di Tito*) makes her role debut as Adalgisa. COC General Director noted that Kevin Newbury's production "looks kind of ancient but not ancient at the same time." *Norma* runs from **October 6 to November 5**. For full details, [click here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1617Season/Norma.aspx).

## *Ariodante*

COC Music Director [**Johannes Debus**](/scene/people/johannes-debus/) makes his Handel debut this fall, conducting a star cast in **Richard Jones'** production of *Ariodante*. [**Alice Coote**](/talking-with-singers-alice-coote/) returns to the COC after her stunning Dejanira in Peter Sellars' *Hercules*, to sing the title role, opposite [**Jane Archibald**](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) making her role debut as Ginevra. Armenian mezzo-soprano **Varduhi Abrahamyam** makes her Canadian debut as Ariodante's rival, Polinesso. The cast also include COC Ensemble Studio graduates [**Ambur Braid**](/talking-with-singers-ambur-braid) as Dalinda and [**Owen McCausland**](/scene/people/owen-mccausland/) as Lurcanio. *Ariodante* runs from **October 16 to November 4**.

## *The Magic Flute*

In the winter of 2017, the COC revisits Diane Paulus' staging of *The Magic Flute*, with COC Ensemble Studio graduate [**Ashlie Corcoran**](/scene/people/ashlie-corcoran/) making her mainstage directing debut. Maestro **Bernard Labadie** makes his COC debut conducting two exciting casts: rising tenors [**Owen McCausland**](/scene/people/owen-mccausland/) and [**Andrew Haji**](/scene/people/andrew-haji/) share the role of Tamino, opposite Paminas **Elena Tsallagova** and **Kristen MacKinnon**. Canadian baritone [**Joshua Hopkins**](/talking-figaro-with-joshua-hopkins/) returns to the COC to sing Papageno, sharing the role with **Phillip Addis** (*Pyramus and Thisbe*). Ensemble Studio grad [**Ambur Braid**](/talking-with-singers-ambur-braid/) will sing one of her signature roles, the Queen of the Night, alongside American soprano **Kathryn Lewek**. *The Magic Flute* will be sung in German, and runs from **January 19 to February 24**.

## *Götterdämmerung*

To round out the COC's ongoing *Ring Cycle* comes **Tim Albery**'s *Götterdämmerung*, with designer **Michael Levine**, and conducted by **Johannes Debus**. Wagnerian favourite **Christine Goerke** will wow us once again with her stellar Brünnhilde, opposite **Andreas Schager** as Siegfried. German baritone **Martin Ganter** is Siegfried's rival, Gunther, and Estonian bass **Ain Anger** is Gunther's half-brother, Hagen. Canadian bass [**Robert Pomakov**](/talking-with-singers-robert-pomakov) returns to sing Alberich, and COC Ensemble Studio grad [**Ileana Montalbetti**](/scene/people/ileana-montalbetti/) sings Gutrune. *Götterdämmerung* runs from **February 2 to 25**.

## *Louis Riel*

In a very Canadian opera indeed, Harry Somers' *Louis Riel* comes to the COC stage, directed by **Peter Hinton** and conducted by **Johannes Debus**. Beloved baritone **Russell Braun** will sing the title role, among a cast filled with Canada's best: [**James Westman**](/scene/people/james-westman/)(*Die Fledermaus*) sings Sir John A. MacDonald, [**Simone Osborne**](/talking-with-singers-simonse-osborne/) is his wife, Marguerite; mezzo [**Allyson McHardy**](/scene/people/allyson-mchardy/) is his mother, Julie; **Michael Colvin** is Thomas Scott, and [**John Relyea**](/scene/people/john-relyea/) is Bishop Taché. *Louis Riel* was composed for Canada's centennial anniversary in 1967, and for it's sesquicentennial, it will grace the Four Seasons Centre stage. It runs for seven shows, **April 20 to May 15**. For full details, [click here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1617Season/LouisRiel.aspx).

## *Tosca*

For the season's fix of beloved classics, Scottish director **Paul Curran** returns to the COC to direct his lush staging of Puccini's *Tosca*, conducted by Canadian maestra **Keri-Lynn Wilson** (women are a rarity on the podium, no doubt). Two casts are featured in the run, starring sopranos [**Adrianne Pieczonka**](/scene/people/adrianne-pieczonka/) and **Keri Alkema** in the title role. Star tenor **Ramón Vargas** returns to the COC for the first time since his Manrico in *Il trovatore*, to debut the role of Cavaradossi; he shares the role with Italian tenor **Andrea Carè** (*Madama Butterfly*). German bass-baritone **Markus Marquadt** sings the role of Scarpia in his Canadian debut. *Tosca* runs **April 30 to May 30**; for full details, [click here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1617Season/Tosca.aspx).

## Extras

On **November 3, 2016**, the COC presents [*Centre Stage*](http://coccentrestage.ca/), its annual Ensemble Studio Competition. The final round of auditions for the COC Ensemble Studio are heard in the Four Seasons Centre, with **Maestro Debus** conducting the COC Orchestra, as the finalists compete for prizes and the chance to join Canada's leading young artist programme. In the 2016/17 season, seven (7!) new singers will joing the Ensemble Studio; that's pretty significant, and I'm officially curious to hear the new crew. For full details, [click here](http://coccentrestage.ca/).

Finally, the COC has decided to change up its annual tradition of the Ensemble Studio Performance, where one performance of an ongoing mainstage production is cast with members of the young artist program, offering them a big-deal opportunity to take Four Seasons Centre stage. On **February 23, 2017**, the COC hosts the [*Ensemble Studio Showcase*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1617Season/EnsembleShowcase.aspx), an evening of semi-staged operatic scenes chosen to show off the rising stars. The programme is still TBA, but historically, tickets for the Ensemble Studio performances sell out quickly.
