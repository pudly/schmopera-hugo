Readers, summer is creeping nearer, which means we're almost due for our annual warm-weather series of "Spotlight on..." interviews!

Our Spotlight series focuses on singers, conductors, and directors, and we tend to have a soft spot for artists who are just kicking off their exciting careers. Some of our memorable Spotlight interviews include chats with soprano [Amanda Majeski](/spotlight-on-amanda-majeski/), baritone [Keith Lam](/spotlight-on-keith-lam/) and mezzo-soprano [Stephanie Tritchew](/spotlight-on-stephanie-tritchew/).

We have an ongoing list of artists to keep an eye on, and we want your help in expanding that list. So, if you know an artist who deserves a little spotlight, let us know! Call them out in the comments, or get in touch directly at [hello@schmopera.com](mailto:hello@schmopera.com). 

And hey, if that deserving artist is *you*, all the more reason to introduce yourself.
