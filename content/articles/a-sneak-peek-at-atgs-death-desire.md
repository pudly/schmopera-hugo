This week, [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) gave a preview of their upcoming show, *Death & Desire*, in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre. *Death & Desire* combines two song cycles, Schubert's *Die Schöne Müllerin* and Messaien's *Harawi*. The two protagonists of each respective cycle are faced with each other in this "double-poeticism" by Artistic Director [Joel Ivany](/scene/people/joel-ivany/). After the arresting musical preview, I was about to speak with singers [Krisztina Szabó](/scene/people/krisztina-szabó/) and [Stephen Hegedus](/scene/people/stephen-hegedus/), as well as AtG Music Director and pianist, [Topher Mokrzewski](/scene/people/christopher-mokrzewski/). I asked them about mashing up Schubert and Messaien, and what audiences can expect from this production.

*Death & Desire* plays June 2-5th at the Neubacher Shor Contemporary, 5 Brock Ave., Toronto. For details and tickets, follow the Box Office links below.
