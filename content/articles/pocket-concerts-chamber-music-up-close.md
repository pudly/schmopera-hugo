[Pocket Concerts](/scene/companies/pocket-concerts/) is a Toronto-based concert series, which brings chamber music to private homes, offices, and other intimate venues. Their most recent [public event](http://www.pocketconcerts.ca/#!public-pocket-concerts/c192n) was their November 29th Party with Brahms at the Wharf, hosted by Howard Cohen and Ron Solskone, where they treated audiences to string quintets and sextets by Brahms and Mozart.
