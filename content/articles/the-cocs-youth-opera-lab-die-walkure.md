	The Canadian Opera Company offers plenty of 
	<a href="http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn.aspx" target="_blank">education programs</a> for young people and adults, including their <a href="http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/YoungAdults/YouthOperaLab.aspx" target="_blank">Youth Opera Lab</a>. The YOL is designed to give young opera fans a chance to dive deeply into the shows in the COC's season, and this month, the focus was on Atom Egoyan's upcoming production of <a href="http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DieWalkure.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Die Walküre</em></a>. Participants were able to talk with COC Orchestra Concertmaster <a href="http://marieberard.ca/" target="_blank">Marie Bérard</a> and Music Director and <em>Walküre </em>conductor <a href="http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx" target="_blank">Johannes Debus</a>, and even watch part of their rehearsal at the Four Seasons Centre. I chatted with participants (Maria Milenic, Elliott McMurchy, and Joseph Glaser) about why they signed up for this Youth Opera Lab.
