preamble: |-
  Russian mezzo-soprano [Aigul Akhmetshina](/scene/people/aigul-akhmetshina/) is in the middle of her first season as a Jette Parker Young Artist at the Royal Opera House. In last month's production of *La tragédie de Carmen* at Wilton's Music Hall, Akhmetshina gave a ["devastating" performance](/akhmetshinas-devastating-carmen-at-wiltons-music-hall/) of the title role; later this season, she's set to sing Mercédès in Barrie Kosky's production of *Carmen*, and Sonyetka in Richard Jones' critically acclaimed production of *Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk*.

  Akhmetshina spoke with us about her exhaustive love for her work, and her own opinions on that iconic figure on every mezzo's mind, Carmen.

## Why do you sing professionally?

Because I cannot live without singing! God gave me my voice and I have been working on it all my life. Now I want to perform the music I love and give people the joy of hearing it.

## What do you know now about the singing career that you wish you knew 10 years ago?

I was 10 years old back then and simply loved singing… and I didn't think much about anything at that stage, happily! But I knew one thing for certain: I knew that singing would become my profession!

## What kind of woman is Carmen? What do you think are some common misconceptions about her character?

Carmen is often misunderstood, she is a very complex character… I think that her insolent and provocative behaviour hides her vulnerability and even certain desperation… Perhaps at a tender age she suffered a lot. I love her very much and consider her to be a strong person with much depth to her character. I hope one day I will have an opportunity to show a different Carmen to my audience.

## How do you relax between rehearsals and performances? Do you have any favourite spots in London?

To be honest, I don't like to be idle! If it were possible, I would live in the opera house!

But I like to spend my free time with my close friends who've become like family to me. I love walking in a park and my favourite place in London at present is Greenwich Park. It is a magical place! The more I get to know London, the deeper I fall in love with it!
