On this beautiful Saturday morning, we've got exciting news to announce! 

For four weeks starting Monday, I'll be writing from the beautiful Banff Centre, where I'll be joining [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/) and the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/) at Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century. I'll be there to music direct the workshop production of James Rolfe's new opera, [*Crush*](/more-atg-in-banff-2015/), which is a completely cool take (homage?) on the Don Juan story and Mozart's *Don Giovanni*. Also being workshopped is the third in Joel Ivany's transladaptations&trade; of the Mozart/Da Ponte operas, entitled [*A Little Too Cozy*](/atg-in-banff-2015).

So, between rehearsals (and probably a bit during), we'll be able to bring you daily updates on the goings-on of the artists and faculty at Open Space 2015. Conductors wearing cameras, hiking with opera singers, interviews with the likes of Russell Braun and Frederica von Stade, the whole deal.

Check back early next week to find a new section on Schmopera.com, where you can find everything #Banff2015. In the meantime, catch up on meeting the casts of *Crush* and *A Little Too Cozy* in the links below!
