  rehearsal for Lohengrin at Fundação Theatro Municipal de São Paulo, or watch Yannick
  Nézet-Séguin conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, or basically stand
  onstage for a rehearsal of Gregory Doran&#039;s Henry V at The Royal Shakespeare

Readers, you're gonna love this.

Google has created a [new platform](https://performingarts.withgoogle.com/en_us) for experiencing live music and theatre, and it's by far the coolest thing I've found on the Internet since [Touch Pianist](http://touchpianist.com/). The [Google Cultural Institute](https://performingarts.withgoogle.com/en_us) features an impressive collection of media for the world's greatest opera houses, theatre companies, ballet companies, and symphony orchestras. 

You can listen to the dress rehearsal for *Lohengrin* at Fundação Theatro Municipal de São Paulo, or watch [Yannick Nézet-Séguin](/scene/people/yannick-nezet-seguin/) conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, or basically stand onstage for a rehearsal of Gregory Doran's *Henry V* at The Royal Shakespeare Company. Multiple 360˚ cameras are placed in the space, sitting you right among the woodwinds, or centre stage among the sets. You can click and drag to look around, and you can easily switch back and forth between points of view by clicking on the numbers at the bottom of the screen. 

*So cool*.

The four 360˚ events are just the tip of the iceberg. You can check out video clips, photos, virtual tours and more from The [Berliner Staatsoper](/scene/comapies/berliner-staatsoper/), the National Ballet of Canada, Comédie des Champs Elysées, and [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/).

I can't wait for this to become a standard practice for the performing arts industries. Check it out for yourself [right here](https://performingarts.withgoogle.com/en_us), and get addicted.
