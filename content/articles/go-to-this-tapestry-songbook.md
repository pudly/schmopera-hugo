In the evening of February 1st, I'll be working on the west end. I wish I could be in the Distillery District, however, to catch Tapestry Opera's presentation of their Tapestry Songbook Concert. Featuring Canadian mezzo Krisztina Szabó and pianist Dr. Chris Foley, the concert will be a showcase of operatic scenes and arias from Tapestry's impressive collection of new Canadian works.

With an intimate performance space and an atmosphere of artistic sincerity, Tapestry productions are always unique, and I will forever plug them. In their open operatic workshops, attendees get a chance to observe Canadian artists as they think out loud, showing their work within the process with the goal of listening to the audience.

This concert will feature a perfect sampling of Canadian opera by Canadian artists, making it easy for the opera-curious to get in-the-know quickly.

The Tapestry Songbook Concert starts at 7:30pm on February 1st, 2014, at the Ernest Balmer Studio in the Distillery District. For tickets and more info, click [here](https://tapestryopera.com/tapestry-songbook-2014).
