This weekend, I'm going to see more stuff.

On Friday night, I'm catching opening night of Engelbert Humperdinck's _Hänsel & Gretel_, presented by [Metro Youth Opera](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/). I love this show, I know a few people involved, and I always fall for a fairy tale.

You can catch MYO founder and artistic director [Kate Applin](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/artistic-director/) as Gretel, and the whole production is put on by upcoming Canadian talent. _Hänsel & Gretel_ runs for three performances, April 25th, 26th (7:30pm shows) and 27th (2:30 matinee) at the Aki Studio Theatre, 585 Dundas Street East, Toronto. For more details and to purchase tickets, click [here](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/).

And on Saturday, another opening night, I'll see Lully's _Persée_ at [Opera Atelier](http://www.operaatelier.com/season/13-14/persee/). The show stars two COC Ensemble Studio graduates: tenor [Chris Enns](http://barczablog.com/2013/01/25/10forenns/) as Persée, and soprano [Mireille Asselin](http://www.mireilleasselin.com/) as Andromède.

Actually, _Persée_ is a good chance to see plenty of Canadian talent on one stage, and I have an inside informant who tells me there will be a sword fight. Good stuff. _Persée _opens April 26th, and runs until  For details about the cast and creative team, and how to get tickets, click [here](http://www.operaatelier.com/season/13-14/persee/).

Finally, the Canadian Opera Company presents Donizetti's [_Roberto Devereux_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/RobertoDevereux.aspx)  at the Four Seasons Centre, opening this Friday. Sondra Radvanovsky sings the role of Queen Elizabeth I, and I've heard opera babble about how ridiculously amazing she is.  Canadians Russell Braun and Allyson McHardy share the stage with Sondra, and I can't wait for my Tuesday night tickets. I suppose two opening nights out of three isn't bad. _Roberto Devereux_ plays until May 21st, so click [here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Tickets/IndividualTickets.aspx) to buy tickets.
