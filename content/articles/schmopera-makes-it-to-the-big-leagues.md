Great news! I'll be making an appearance on behalf of [Schmopera](http://schmopera.com/) on the [Big COC Podcast](http://www.coc.ca/~/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?Category=The+Big+COC+Podcast)! With host [Gianmarco Segato](https://twitter.com/ducadiposa), I'll be joined by maestro [Stephen Lord](http://schmopera.com/stephen-lord-on-singers-on-bel-canto-and-on-theatre/), who's in town conducting _A Masked Ball_ at the Canadian Opera Company, and by [Paula Citron](http://paulacitron.ca/meet-paula/), arts journalist, critic and broadcaster, and a past guest of the podcast.

I won't yet divulge the topics of discussion, but stay tuned early next week for our short teaser; we'll show you some behind-the-scenes footage with the guests of this week's podcast.

If you're new to the Big COC Podcast, head over now and check out their episode archive. Past guests include soprano Simone Osborne, critics John Terauds and Joseph So, _Opera Canada_ editor Wayne Gooding, and creators of _Against the Grain Theatre_ Joel "Ginger Ninja" Ivany and Christopher "Matzo Ball" Mokrzewski. It's definitely worth the listen.

Again, I can't reveal our topics, but clearly there will be a little [#Superbowl](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Superbowl%20opera&src=typd), a little [#OpeningCeremony](https://twitter.com/search?q=openingceremony%20opera&src=typd), maybe a little [#SamuelLJackson](https://twitter.com/SamuelLJackson/status/430119676967157761).
