preamble: Merry Christmas, readers! This week marks the obligatory Christmas-type
  post, where our attention goes to snow, pretty lights, overindulgence, and Christmas
  songs. Love them or hate them, you can always count on opera singers to melt the
  heart strings with their opera-sized carolling. Happy holidays to all of you, and
  enjoy the schmaltz.

Christmas is a great time for mashing unlikely singers together onto one stage so they can all sing some carols together. Like in 2000, when Plácido Domingo did a holiday concert with Vanessa Williams, Tony Bennett, and Charlotte Church. Here's Plácido and Tony giving us a good old "The First Noël":

This next one has got to be my favourite. In an homage to both Christmastime collaborations, and sort of to David Bowie's [infamous duet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiXjbI3kRus) with Bing Crosby in 1977, Bryn Terfel takes his turn to duet with the late voice of Bing to sing "White Christmas". It's bizarre and amazing; I love how Bryn takes a breath between "Christ-" and "-mases" as the end.

In 2006, Renée Fleming joined the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for their Christmas concert, to sing "I'll Be Home for Christmas". The singing is [extra scoopy](/hot-topics-singers-who-scoop/) and the set is big-scale-holiday-concert-fabulous. #toomanypoinsettias.

I suppose it's not Christmas without the Three Tenors, right? Here's their "Silent Night", in as many languages as they could fit in, and a curious order of designating solo verses that has me curious about their management.

For some classy Christmas carolling, one can always count on Leontyne Price. Have a listen to her stunning singing of "O Holy Night". You'll want to hang in for the big high note, I promise you.

Finally, this gem. In 1957, Frank Sinatra directed *Happy Holidays with Bing & Frank*, starring himself and Bing Crosby. If you've not seen it, it starts out with a warm Christmas visit, and it's just worth the watch.
