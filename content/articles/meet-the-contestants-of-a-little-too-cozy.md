## What was your first thought when you found out you’d be a contestant on *A Little Too Cozy*?

**Felicity**: I was really excited that I might finally have the chance to meet my future husband!

**Elmo**: I was completely caught off guard – surprised, to say the least. I immediately phoned my best buddy Fernando, as I knew he also auditioned to be on the show. After the initial shock wore off I was overcome with a great feeling of hope, excitement and wonder. It was amazing to think that after going through so many women, who just didn't do it for me, I had the opportunity to finally find The One - my sweet, my jewel, my lovely....my love!

**Fernando**: I was SO excited when I found out I was selected to be a contestant on *A Little Too Cozy*! I called my entire family. My great grandmother was so excited for me!!!

**Dora**: I thought, "well, why not?" It can't be more horrifying than what's on the street, so worst case scenario, it gets me off of work for a while.  ;)

## How have you been allowed to communicate with the guys? What’s not allowed? 

**Elmo**: No physical contact is allowed on this show. I have never even seen any of the women, no idea what they look like. I mean, most of them seem pretty hot but I don't really know. Not that that matters really as I'm finished picking my women based on physical appearances. I've been able to text and email. We get one text date a week. It's really opened my eyes to how sexy you can be through emojis. One date got really heated and hot - I mean it almost went all the way… I did, anyway ;).

**Felicity**: We've only been able to communicate on our phones. We are allowed to text each other but we can't send any selfies. I have no idea what Elmo looks like at all, but I am so intrigued to find out.

**Dora**: We communicate by text…but it's hard to get to know someone by text only. Nowadays, everybody sounds great by text, but really life is very different. We’ve kept conversations light and easy. I send him a cutesy emoji combo every night before bed instead of engaging deeply on anything of substance.

**Fernando**: We only communicate with text. It’s crazy - I've only sent her texts and e-mails, but I'm sure I can picture her beautiful face. I know her soul is beautiful though – and that's all that really matters anyways.

## What was the cutest text you’ve gotten yet from your man/lady? Any memorable emojis?

**Felicity**: Elmo once texted me, "I know we haven't met in person, but I really feel like you are my one and only." And he sends the cutest emojis! Puppy love, kitty kiss, and spinning hearts.

**Elmo**: I have such a connection with this girl Felicity. I mean it's hard to single out one text. Everything she sends me, I'm so invested in what it means, how she's feeling, how I'm feeling. One night she sent me this emoji with the number eight, a couple of equal signs, a hand over the equal signs, the letter D and a sprinkle of water. It took me a while to get it but oh baby, I'm in it deep with her.

**Fernando**: Dora sends me this every night before bed! It's so adorable!

## What would be any "deal-breakers" when you finally get to meet your man/lady?

**Dora**: Bad teeth. Anyone I date definitely needs to have clean teeth! Also, I'm ok with beards, but not if I can smell what you had for breakfast that day. So trim that thing down. Also, I like to wear heels and don't really like to feel like Brienne in *Game of Thrones* next to a man I'm dating, so... no short men.

**Fernando**: As long as she is honest and true, she will be absolutely perfect. From what I know about Dora so far, she is the epitome of perfection.

**Felicity**: I will not put up with him if he is rude, lazy, inconsiderate, and if he likes himself more than me. I have been with too many self-absorbed men, and I'm not going to waste my time with them anymore.

**Elmo**: There are no deal breakers for Elmo. I'm so connected with Felicity that nothing could pull us apart. It's such a different experience. My love burns for her like a sizzling rump roast at Christmas dinner.

## Is he/she marriage material? 

**Elmo**: Felicity is definitely marriage material. She is just dirty enough through texting and emails but for the first time in my life she calls me on my bullshit. And I just take it. She makes me a better person and always puts me first. I really feel she has my best interests at heart and I find I'm wanting to do the same for her. This is real, I'm getting married, starting a family and living happily ever after with my sweet Felicity.

**Felicity**: I think Elmo shows a lot of potential, but time will tell.

**Fernando**: I wouldn't even send her a message back if she wasn't! She is my BAE.

**Dora**: So far he's not creep material, so there's hope.
