  [Essential Opera](/scene/companies/essential-opera/) is a Toronto-based company which presents, well, opera's bare essentials: great artists, great music, and great storytelling. Sopranos, Co-Founders and Co-Artistic Directors [Maureen Batt](/scene/people/maureen-batt/) and [Erin Bardua](/scene/people/erin-bardua/) chat about how their lean and portable approach to opera makes it a closer, even cheaper, experience for audiences.

  Essential Opera's new seasons starts October 8th in Halifax, with a presentation of Elisha Denburg's *Regina* at the Gilsig Series in Jewish Arts & Culture at Dalhousie University. *Regina* reprises along with Monica Pearce's *Etiquette* in Ottawa on October 16-18, in conjunction with [Opera Lyra Ottawa](/scene/companies/opera-lyra-ottawa/).
