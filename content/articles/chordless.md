When New York City-based soprano [Sara LeMesh](https://www.saralemesh.com/) and San Francisco-based pianist [Allegra Chapman](https://www.allegrachapman.com/) work together, they're known as [Chordless](https://chordlessduo.com/), the piano-voice duo that's dedicated to shining some spotlight on lesser known pieces of music. Via Zoom on **May 29 at 5pm PDT/8pm EDT**, Chordless is launching its biggest project to date: their first music video, set to "The Night in Silence Under Many a Star", one of nine songs that make up George Crumb's _Apparition_.

The video, created by independent filmmaker Joseph Dwyer and with sound engineering by Matt Carr, kicks off the event. After its premiere screening, there will be a moderated Q&A with LeMesh, Chapman, Dwyer and Carr, which will then get extended to audience questions.

It's a unique event, covering a timely topic: creating classical music in a world flooded by digital media. Music videos for works like _Apparition_ are comparably rare, and often a bit baffling even to fans of the music, and artists are making sense of their reasons for putting out digital content when, pre-pandemic, they had no real plans to do so.

But Chordless has created an intriguing piece of art with this Crumb video, and it'll be a neat experience to view it, and then have an immediate face-to-face (or screen-to-screen) with the folks who made it.

You can catch a little snippet of the video below. To tune in for its full release, [register for free right here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/chordless-online-music-video-premiere-discussion-tickets-104455443042).
