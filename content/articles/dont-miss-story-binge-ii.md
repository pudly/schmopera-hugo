Are you an opera fan with a short attention span? On **December 15, 7:30pm ET**, head over to Kaufman Music Center's Merkin Concert Hall for [*Story Binge II*](http://experimentsinopera.com/portfolio-item/1876/), a night of five operatic premieres by five New York-based composers. It's the second annual *Binge* , presented by [Experiments in Opera](http://experimentsinopera.com/about/).

This year's line-up is an intriguing collection of opera shorts and scenes from larger works, telling stories about everything: break-ups, moving to Mars, copyright infringement, women from the Bible, life as a POW, and even different societal perceptions of AIDS. The full line-up:

<ul class="nospace">

<li>Nick Hallett's *To Music* (Scene 2)
<li>Roddy Bottom's *The Ride* 
<li>Jason Cady's *I Need Space* 
<li>Lainie Fefferman's *White Fire*
<li>Matthew Welch and Daniel Neer's *And Here We Are*

</ul>

Clear champions of living composers, Brooklyn-based Experiments in Opera has commissioned 45 new works in just five years. Composers and founders Aaron Siegel, Matthew Welch and Jason Cady are also dedicated to the library of resources - [videos](http://experimentsinopera.com/videos/), [books](http://experimentsinopera.com/books/) - that continuously builds out of Experiments in Opera's projects.
