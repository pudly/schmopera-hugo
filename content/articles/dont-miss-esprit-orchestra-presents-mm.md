The Esprit Orchestra's programme for its second concert of the season is essentially one attention-grabbing piece after another. 

On **November 20, 8pm at Koerner Hall**, Esprit presents *m'M*, a concert of music written in the last few decades, named after the *concerto grosso* by Philippe Leroux, which closes the evening; Esprit Music Director Alex Pauk conducts the programme, which also includes two Canadian premieres.

The "M" in Leroux's *m'M* is the phonetic interpretation of the French word for "love" ("aime"); complementary to the *concerto grosso* form - a handful of musicians playing alongside a large ensemble - Leroux offers that "'m' represents a small group of instrumentalists within the orchestra, and 'M' represents the remaining larger combination of players surrounding the small group."

Also on the programme: "a rare listening opportunity" for Esprit audiences, the first Canadian performances of George Crumb's *A Haunted Landscape* (1984), and of Marc-André Dalbavie's *Concerto for Cello and Orchestra* (2013), inspired by the virtuosic playing of Joseph Johnson, principal cellist of the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/companies/toronto-symphony-orchestra/). Plus, Canadian composer Zosha Di Castri's *Alba* evokes dawn in the prairies of Northern Alberta; where other composers link the morning with dew and birds, Di Castri asks, "But what about dawn in the dead of winter?"

*m'M* happens **November 20, 8pm at Koerner Hall**; preceding the concert is a conversation moderated by Canadian composer Alexina Louie, starting at 7:15pm. Tickets start at $20, so [click here](http://www.espritorchestra.com/buytickets/concert2.html) to find out more.
