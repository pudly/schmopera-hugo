"Shoestring Opera's Carmen is a feisty little girl with a dark past. Adopted by a Canadian uncle, she is a newcomer to this country struggling to fit in. She loves to dance, and sing, and is fiercely independent. When Tory Adair, 'the coolest kid in school', tries to bully her, she stands up to him. When he calls her and her dancing 'stupid', she flies into a rage and chases him all around the schoolyard. But this lands her in a whole lot of trouble and she is sent to the Principal's office—on her first day at school!"
