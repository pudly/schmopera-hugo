On the opposite coast, Boston-based [Odyssey Opera](/scene/companies/odyssey-opera/) is set to offer its latest in opera's under-performed masterpieces. Saint-Saëns' 1883 opera, [_Henry VIII_](https://www.odysseyopera.org/2019-saint-saens-henry-viii/), centres on the famed love triangle between the Tudor king, his first wife Catherine of Aragon, and his soon-to-be second wife, Anne Boleyn.

"_Henry VIII_ has all the ingredients of a spectacular grand opera," says Odyssey Opera Artistic and General Director Gil Rose. "It has a sensational historical subject and sweeping vocal melodies and rich orchestral writing." The original score saw several cuts after its premiere, but Odyssey Opera is working with Saint-Saëns scholar Hugh MacDonald to put together a recreation that, "for all intents and purposes, represents the world premiere!"

[_Henry VIII_](https://www.odysseyopera.org/2019-saint-saens-henry-viii/), starring baritone Michael Chioldi in the title role, happens September 21 at NEC's Jordan Hall.
