short_description: So, I went to this year&#039;s Operanation and I had a blast. There
  were bright beehive wigs, Calvin Klein underwear models, the fab Keith Cole and
  his walking flash mob, and of course some awesome music by Yelle, DJ Phil &amp;
  DJ Cozmic Cat, joined by the guests of honour, the COC Ensemble Studio. I wandered
  around with my camera clicking, and got a few great shots to share. Enjoy!

So, I went to this year's [Operanation](https://twitter.com/Operanation) and I had a blast. There were bright beehive wigs, Calvin Klein underwear models, the fab [Keith Cole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Cole_(performance_artist)) and his walking flash mob, and of course some awesome music by Yelle, DJ Phil & DJ Cozmic Cat, joined by the guests of honour, the [COC Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx). I wandered around with my camera clicking, and got a few great shots to share. Enjoy!
