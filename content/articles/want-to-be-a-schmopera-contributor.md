Here at Schmopera, we're proud that we can write about the opera industry from within it. We want as big a slice as possible of the current artists, teachers, and fans, so we can keep bringing you the most relevant and important topics. To do that, we're reaching out for new contributors! We've updated our new [Contribute page](/about/contribute/), which tells you what we're looking for and from whom. If you have the start of an idea or two that you'd like to write about, don't be shy, send it our way. There's no commitment or pressure, we simply want to hear what you all think of our beloved opera industry.

Do you have lots of writing experience? Amazing. None at all? Could be even better. Either way, if you're interested, hit the big blue button below:
