Sometimes the best way to get a snapshot of history is not to look at the major figures of the time, but of their lesser-known contemporaries.

Tafelmusik is shining light on one such lesser-known composer, Agostino Steffani (1654-1728), in their upcoming concerts **November 8-11**, entitled [*Steffani: Drama & Devotion*](https://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/steffani-drama-devotion). Steffani had an interesting life; he was a celebrated composer and mentor to Handel, and he also worked as a diplomat and ecclesiastic. 

"He spins a beautiful melody," says mezzo-soprano [Krisztina Szabó](/scene/people/krisztina-szabo/), who joins the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra and Chamber Choir under director Ivars Taurins on this programme of Steffani's music. The composer's style, "for me, it falls between Cavalli and Handel."

The programme's first half is devoted to Steffani's *Stabat Mater* (1728), and the second half is a pastiche of arias, duets with Szabó and fellow mezzo-soprano [Victoria Marshall](/scene/people/victoria-marshall/), choruses, and instrumental music from his operas. Save for the *Stabat Mater*, all of the items on this concert are being performed by Tafelmusik for the first time. "The one that makes me happiest to sing is 'Ogni core' from *Servio Tullo*," says Szabó, nodding to the final aria on the evening's line-up.

Szabó has a steady relationship with Tafelmusik, and she'll collaborate with them again next month for Handel's [*Messiah*](https://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/handel-messiah-1), **December 18-21** at Koerner Hall, and for their infamous [*Sing-Along Messiah*](https://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/sing-along-messiah-roy-thomson-hall) at Roy Thomson Hall, **December 22, 2pm**.

>*Steffani: Drama & Devotion* happens at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre, November 8-10 at 8pm, and November 11 at 3:30pm. For full details and ticket information, [click here.](https://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/steffani-drama-devotion)
