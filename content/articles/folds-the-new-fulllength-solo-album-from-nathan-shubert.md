short_description: There&#039;s an appealing subtlety to Folds, a muted chain of pieces
  that wavers between improvisation and a feeling of familiarity. &quot;Expressive
  and accessible, Nathan wrote these pieces purely for the pleasure and beauty inherent
  in them, not as exercises in composerly rigor or pianistic dexterity. Free of external
  meanings, the pieces take on their own deeply implicit, wordless significance. These
  pieces became Folds.&quot;

We first heard the music of Vancouver-based pianist Nathan Shubert on [Official Piano Day 2016](/nathan-shubert-makes-the-most-of-official-piano-day/), when he released his "Saga Norén, Länskrim, Malmö", including a [live studio video](https://youtu.be/x8OG3fY-W4Y).

Later this month, Shubert releases *Folds*, his debut full-length solo album of original modern classical music. With a rich history of making music in Vancouver (including collaborations with [No Sinner](https://nosinner.bandcamp.com/), [David Newberry](http://davidnewberrymusic.com/), [Jody Glenham](https://jodyglenham.bandcamp.com/), [Lydia Hol](http://www.lydiahol.com/) and [Minto](https://minto.bandcamp.com/)), Shubert steps into the solo spotlight. 

There's an appealing subtlety to *Folds*, a muted chain of pieces that wavers between improvisation and a feeling of familiarity. "Expressive and accessible, Nathan wrote these pieces purely for the pleasure and beauty inherent in them, not as exercises in composerly rigor or pianistic dexterity. Free of external meanings, the pieces take on their own deeply implicit, wordless significance. These pieces became *Folds*."
