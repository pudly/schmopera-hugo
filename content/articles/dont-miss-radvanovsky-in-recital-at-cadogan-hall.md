  says Rosenblatt, founder of the series, of Radvanovsky&#039;s place as a leading
  soprano in opera today. &quot;The actual instrument itself is nothing short of a
  marvel – it&#039;s a huge voice but one that she&#039;s able to use with complete

  touches whoever she&#039;s singing with.&quot;'

"I have no doubt it'll be one of the greatest recitals we've ever presented," says [Ian Rosenblatt](/ian-rosenblatt-its-all-about-the-voice/) of [Sondra Radvanovsky](/talking-with-singers-sondra-radvanovsky/)'s upcoming recital in London. On **March 16, 7:30pm**, star soprano - and [queen of Queens](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/arts/music/sondra-radvanovsky-opera-royalty-takes-on-donizettis-triple-crown.html) - will sing at Cadogan Hall with pianist Anthony Manoli as part of the Rosenblatt Recitals series.

"There's an intensity and dramatic commitment with Sondra that's made her connect with audiences in a way few singers are able to do," says Rosenblatt, founder of the series, of Radvanovsky's place as a leading soprano in opera today. "The actual instrument itself is nothing short of a marvel – it's a huge voice but one that she's able to use with complete control so that she's also able to sing the most delicate of phrasing that touches whoever she's singing with."

The [Rosenblatt Recitals Series](/ian-rosenblatt-its-all-about-the-voice/) has a strong history of fostering the careers of established and emerging singers. The likes of [Ailyn Pérez](/scene/people/ailyn-perez/), [Juan Diego Flórez](/scene/people/juan-diego-florez/), [Joseph Calleja](/scene/people/joseph-calleja/), [Quinn Kelsey](/scene/people/quinn-kelsey/), and [Nicole Cabell](/talking-with-singers-nicole-cabell/) have enjoyed the professional boost with the London-based series. "While it's a coup for us that she's agreed to sing as part of the series," says Rosenblatt, "I have to say it's one of many coups that the series has enjoyed having given so many then unknown singers their UK debuts. So, she'll be in great company of singers who've appeared in the series!"

On Radvanovsky's programme are picks by Vivaldi, Strauss, Barber, and for the *bel canto* singing her audiences crave, Bellini. Rosenblatt Recitals are usually held at Wigmore Hall, yet the demand for Sondra called for the larger Cadogan Hall.

"It's a great thrill for us as she's obviously one of the leading singers of our time. She's really the house diva at the Met and elsewhere," Rosenblatt agrees. Seeing Radvanovsky on the opera stage is a certain rush, but in recital, she shows her warmth and humour. "Her almost daily use of social media, the way she’s so open and warm mean that people can also connect to her on a human level that's very welcoming and involving."

"How many divas sign off their posts with 'hugs'?"

[Tickets](https://www.cadoganhall.com/event/sondra-radvanovsky-170316/) start at just £14, a steal for the chance to be truly thrilled by one of the best voices of today.
