Led by Erika Switzer and Martha Guth, New York-based [Sparks & Wiry Cries](http://www.sparksandwirycries.com/) is a recital series, an ezine, and a commissioning program for new art song, and they're hosting their very first fundraising concert.

On **September 12, 7:30pm** at the Kaufman Music Center's Merkin Concert Hall, Sparks & Wiry Cries presents [*Art Song: Reimagined*](http://www.sparksandwirycries.com/CasementFundSongSeries/UpcomingSeason.aspx), featuring Grammy award-winner [Rhiannon Giddens](http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/#about), co-founder of the [Carolina Chocolate Drops](http://www.carolinachocolatedrops.com/band/about.html), and collaborator with the likes of Yo-Yo Ma, the Kronos Quartet, and The Silk Road Ensemble. On the programme is everything from German Lieder to Black Broadway, and Giddens will be joined by pianist Spencer Myer and Broadway star Darius de Haas (*Rent*, *Carousel*, *Dreamgirls*, *Hair*). 

As the world of opera moves toward chamber-sized orchestras and intimate venues, the world of art song moves in closer. Companies like the [Canadian Art Song Project](/scene/companies/canadian-art-song-project/) and [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/) have wowed audiences with reimagined art song, and so it's an exciting thing to find a supportive organization like Sparks & Wiry Cries that will foster performances and new works.

[Tickets](http://www.kaufmanmusiccenter.org/mch/event/art-song-reimagined-singer-rhiannon-giddens-with-pianist-spencer-myer/) to *Art Song: Reimagined* are $75, and the cost includes a post-concert champagne reception with Rhiannon Giddens.
