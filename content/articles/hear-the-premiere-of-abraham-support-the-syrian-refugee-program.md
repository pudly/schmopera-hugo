Tomorrow night, head to the Metropolitan United Church to hear the première of *Abraham*, a new oratorio by Dora award-winning composer [David Warrack](http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Warrack%2C%20David) (*Torontosaurus*, *Oh Susanna, Interpretations of a Life*). Tickets start at $36, and funds raised will go towards the Church's Syrian Refugee Program.

Warrack was inspired by Abraham's presence in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, hence the oratorio's full title, *Abraham: An Oratorio Dedicated to Progenitor of Three Faiths*. "This oratorio is reminding us that we all come from the same place and we must find a way to share this world. We need to get past a lot of the things that have divided us."

*Abraham* features star Canadian tenor [Richard Margison](/scene/people/richard-margison/) in the title role, joined by soloists Ramona Carmelly, Meredith Hall, Hussein Janmohamed, George Krissa and Theresa Tova, as well as the [Elmer Iseler Singers](http://www.elmeriselersingers.com/), the [Bach Children’s Chorus](http://bachchildrenschorus.ca/), and the [Jarrahi Sufi Choir](http://www.jerrahi.ca/index.html) with Whirling Dervishes. The composer will be at the piano.

>*Abraham* gets its full première on Wednesday, October 28th, 8pm, at Metropolitan United Church in Toronto. For details and ticket information, follow the box office links below.
