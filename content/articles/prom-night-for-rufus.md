Tomorrow night at Royal Albert Hall in London, [Rufus Wainwright](http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2014/september-11/15142) will have his debut performance as part of the BBC Late Night Proms. Rufus is Canada's most chatter-worthy addition to the operatic scene (with his upcoming COC commission, [_Hadrian_](/humility-and-hadrian/)), and he'll be joined by soprano Deborah Voigt to [sing a couple of arias](http://slippedisc.com/2014/09/diva-drops-in-to-late-night-prom/) from his 2009 opera, _Prima Donna_. After the arias, Rufus and Deborah will sing that incorrigible duet from _Carousel_, "If I Loved You". The night will be conducted by the Canadian Opera Company's own Music Director, [Johannes Debus](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx).

The pairing of Rufus and Deborah seems odd at first glance, but after Rufus' infiltration of the opera world and Deborah's [Annie Oakley](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/arts/music/annie-get-your-gun-at-glimmerglass-review.html), it could actually be a cool melding of minds. In either case, the idea totally reminded me of this:
