short_description: The Man Who Married Himself is based in an Indian folk tale, about
  a man who is unwilling to marry a woman, and who instead creates a lover for himself
  out of his own left side. &quot;He finds himself enraptured by his creation&#039;s
  perfect beauty – a mirror of his own – until he discovers that this new woman longs
  for another.&quot;

Next month, [Toronto Masque Theatre](/scene/companies/toronto-masque-theatre/) presents their eighth original commission, *The Man Who Married Himself: Sexuality & Self, Desire & Transformation*. The [masque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masque), inspired by Indian and Baroque performance traditions, is a collaboration by composer [Juliet Palmer](/scene/people/juliet-palmer/) and librettist [Anna Chatterton](/scene/people/anna-chatterton/); the world premiere performance is directed by Marie-Nathalie Lacoursière and features choreography by Hari Krishnan.

*The Man Who Married Himself* is based in an Indian folk tale, about a man who is unwilling to marry a woman, and who instead creates a lover for himself out of his own left side. "He finds himself enraptured by his creation's perfect beauty – a mirror of his own – until he discovers that this new woman longs for another."

Toronto Masque Theatre pulls together three singers (Scott Belluz, Susha Rangarajan, and Alex Samaras), two dancers (Jelani Ade-Lam and Sze-Yang Ade-Lam), and a chamber orchestra led by TMT Artistic Director Larry Beckwith.

"This piece is such a beautiful gift to TMT from two creative artists – Anna and Juliet – who are at the top of their game," says Beckwith. "Taking an ancient tale as their jumping off point, they give us a contemporary story containing insights into gender and sexuality, culture and tradition. The music, which features elements of Baroque music, jazz and Karnatic improvisation, plays off the sinewy, physical movement that is informed by traditional dance but remains at the same time so modern."

*The Man Who Married Himself* plays **at 8pm on March 10 and 11**, with a matinee performance **at 2pm on March 11**. Pre-show events are held 45 minutes prior to curtain. All performances at Crow's Theatre, 345 Carlaw Ave., Toronto.

Tickets start at just $20, and you can get them through TMT's [website](http://torontomasquetheatre.com/node/59) or by calling 416-410-4561.
