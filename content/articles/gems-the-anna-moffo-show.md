preamble: You probably know American-Italian soprano Anna Moffo as Violetta, Susanna,
  Manon, Cio-Cio San, Périchole, Gilda, Lucia di Lammermoor, really any lead soprano
  role in Italian or French, it seems. Have you heard of her Italian TV show from
  the 1960s, *The Anna Moffo Show*? I think it's pretty darn impressive for a woman
  in Italy, 50 years ago, to have her own TV show; not to mention her hosting a revue
  while being the star singer. Curious? Check out this clip. There's air piano, and
  some *Aida*.

short_description: You probably know American-Italian soprano Anna Moffo as Violetta,
  Susanna, Manon, Cio-Cio San, Périchole, Gilda, Lucia di Lammermoor, really any lead
  soprano role in Italian or French, it seems. Have you heard of her Italian TV show
  from the 1960s, Anna Moffo Show? Television and film were always staples in Moffo&#039;s
  operatic career, and I think it&#039;s pretty darn impressive for a woman in Italy,
  50 years ago, to have her own TV show.
