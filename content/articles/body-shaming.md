Opera fans in Canada might have noticed a flurry of activity around _Opera Canada_ magazine, and the review they published by Bill Rankin of Calgary Opera's recent production of _La traviata_.

The story so far is this: Rankin's original review included [the following paragraph](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcjsF1EsfCN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), in reference to stellar Canadian tenor Andrew Haji's performance as Alfredo:

"...When the scene called for an intimate embrace or even just some simple flexibility, however, independent of fine singing, the tenor's stature was an impediment to a convincing effect."

When readers rightly cried body-shaming ⁠— a dumb and persistent element that is still a problem in opera criticism ⁠—  _Opera Canada_ removed the problematic paragraph, but didn't indicate anywhere in the review that an edit had been made. When readers rightly cried editorial bungling, _Opera Canada_ posted a [statement-as-apology on social media](https://www.instagram.com/p/CclNZT_uPFV/), which went over like a lead balloon and got the comment section a-hoppin':

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fjoel.ivany%2Fposts%2F10159093336983600&show_text=true&width=500" width="500" height="629" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>

From what I could see, readers were frustrated with the unkind and totally unnecessary comments on a singer's physical appearance, and also with the fact that the original review made its way by _Opera Canada'_s editorial team in the first place.

Joel Ivany, Artistic Director of Edmonton Opera and Against the Grain Theatre, summed it up well on Facebook:

"Also, the show closed April 8. Generally we like the reviews to sell the show. This review came out April 19, which is more of a 'here's what you missed'.

Unnecessary.

As well, the statement apologizes to the artist, but he has not been emailed or called by anyone. So this blanket statement is that specific apology. He'd have to hear about it from his community."

There's not much to add to this story, but I do feel the urge to offer an opinion, both as someone who has made her own mistakes in opera-critic-land, and someone who used to work for _Opera Canada_.
