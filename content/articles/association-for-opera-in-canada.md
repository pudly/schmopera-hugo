Hi, readers!

A quick heads-up about something very cool out of the Association for Opera in Canada:

The second iteration of the [RBC Artist Fellowship](https://www.opera.ca/programs/leadership-innovation-networking-knowledge-link-emerging-artist-programs/) has been announced, with an aim to give professional experience to Canadian artists in their early careers. Applications for this year's Fellowship are due **October 4, 2021**; you can find the forms in [English](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzRnsXTgQRGVKT4byu-JZJCO-Coxk_77wAKSM8hbWrhfl8eA/viewform) and [French](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0nL0rk-aYXAm--K3JKiYRfhQqTH5Or7EHEoaeEneX75qAxw/viewform).

The Fellowship will go to "exceptional" Canadians in the opera realm: singers, directors, conductors, pianists, designers, and administrators. Recipients will get private mentorship, professional development training sessions and workshops, and networking boosts.

The RBC Artist Fellowship, designed and led by AOC Programs Associate Jaclyn Grossman, is meant "to give a voice and agency to the next generation of artists by providing a platform for discovery and skill development," said AOC in a press release. 

AOC is a still-new iteration of [Opera.ca](https://twitter.com/opera_ca), with goals that agree with the needs of a contemporary artist in the opera sector. Young-artist readers, [consider applying](https://www.opera.ca/programs/leadership-innovation-networking-knowledge-link-emerging-artist-programs/) for this one.
