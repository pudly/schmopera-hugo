The opening night performance of _Tosca_ at the Adrienne Arsht Center on March 18th was a stunning production, led by an outstanding cast and creative team. [Florida Grand Opera](/scene/companies/florida-grand-opera/)'s production is a timeless tale of love, jealousy, and betrayal. Set in 19th-century Rome during the Napoleonic Wars, _Tosca_ follows its titular character who is torn from her love for Mario Cavaradossi by the corrupt police chief Scarpia.

Cavaradossi, an artist and a political idealist, aids in the escape of a political prisoner, attracting the ire of Scarpia who believes that Cavaradossi has information that could be useful in capturing the escapee. However, Scarpia's motivations for arresting Cavaradossi go beyond his duty to protect the government when he ropes Tosca into his investigation.

[Toni Marie Palmertree](/scene/people/toni-marie-palmertree/), who portrayed Floria Tosca, delivered a truly remarkable performance. Her voice was powerful, clear, and expressive, capturing the complex emotions of the character with ease. Palmertree's acting was equally impressive, embodying Tosca's fiery temperament and vulnerabilities masterfully.

[Arturo Chacón Cruz](/scene/people/arturo-chacon-cruz/) brought his considerable talents to the role of Mario Cavaradossi, Tosca's love interest. His vocals were excellent and his rendition of the famous aria "E lucevan le stelle" was particularly moving. [Todd Thomas](/scene/people/todd-thomas/)'s portrayal of the villainous Scarpia was menacing and powerful, capturing the character's cruelty perfectly.

Under the expert direction of Jeffrey Marc Buchman, the production flowed seamlessly. David P. Gordon's set detailed and immersive sets that transported the audience to the heart of Rome in the early 19th century. Conductor Gregory Buchalter's interpretation of Puccini's score was masterful, balancing the dramatic intensity of the story with the musical beauty of the score. The orchestra's playing was impeccable, providing a lush and emotive backdrop for the singers.
