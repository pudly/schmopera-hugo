Pop-Up Opera is a touring company that's passionate about bringing fully-staged productions around the UK, cast with young professional singers at the start of their operatic careers. They adapt eagerly to unconvential venues, like boats, wineries, and caverns; the novel performance spaces let Pop-Up Opera "open the hidden door to this art form and make even more seasoned opera goers feel like they have been given a secret backstage pass."

In March and April, Pop-Up Opera revives their first tragic opera, Bellini's [*I Capuleti e i Montecchi*](http://popupopera.co.uk/whats-on/current/I-Capuleti-e-i-Montecchi/). The production, sung in Italian and featuring "silent movie-style" English captions, heads across the southern UK, including stops at London's The Vaults, **March 20-23.**

"Experimenting with a tragedy is a new direction away from comedy and has been very exciting for us," says Clementine Lovell, Artistic Director of Pop-Up Opera. "Bringing the thrilling drama and heartbrekaing tragedy of this piece into these intimate and atmospheric spaces has presented a new way of engaging our audiences and created something quite visceral."

[*I Capuleti e i Montecchi*](http://popupopera.co.uk/whats-on/current/I-Capuleti-e-i-Montecchi/) stars [Alice Privett](/scene/people/alice-privett.) as Guilietta, [Flora McIntosh](/scene/people/flora-mcintosh/) as Romeo, and [Cliff Zammitt Stevens](/scene/people/cliff-zammitt-stevens/) as Tebaldo.

Touring performances run from **March 7th to Apri 8th, 2017**. For dates, locations, and tickets, [click here.](http://popupopera.co.uk/whats-on/current/I-Capuleti-e-i-Montecchi/)
