Hi, everyone. Jenna here.

Tenors [Isaiah Bell](/the-business-of-passion-part-the-first/) and [Chris Mayell](/chris-mayell-the-opera-career/) have been friends of Schmopera's since its inception. They were the subjects of one of my first [video interviews](https://youtu.be/GKN27ZVONRQ) back in 2013; since then, I've properly [interviewed Chris](/chris-mayell-the-opera-career/), and Isaiah has written some [brilliant contributions of his own](/on-the-ego/).

So, it was super exciting to be invited as a guest on [episode 44 of *Overthought, A Podcast*](http://www.overthoughtpodcast.com/44-diplomacy-or-the-safe-choice/), hosted by Chris and Isaiah. 

The episode is all about being diplomatic and making "safe choices" within operatic circles - something that rings particularly true for me, a pianist and voice coach who started writing about the industry. For the first time, I talk about how scary it was to start Schmopera, and how I wasn't sure I wouldn't be quietly excluded from getting gigs as a pianist and répétiteur.

Diplomacy, indeed. How do I get away with writing about opera from within it, when I know the cast and creative team? How do I publish fair reviews? How do I address problems in different organizations, and decide whether or not to name names? Why do some in the opera industry resort to [anonymity](/audition-season-or-the-annual-festival-of-shattered-dreams/) in order to say what they feel is true?

All these questions, plus a few more Schmopera secrets, are in episode 44, "Diplomacy, or The Safe Choice," available [right here](http://www.overthoughtpodcast.com/44-diplomacy-or-the-safe-choice/).
