[Minnesota Opera](/scene/companies/minnesota-opera/) began their fall 2020 virtual season with [Opera in the Outfield](https://mnopera.org/season/fall-season/opera-in-the-outfield/) at CHS Park in St. Paul. This is their only in-person experience in the fall, and it felt good to be around fellow opera fans. The seventy-five-minute presentation featured current resident artists singing selections, over a slideshow of production photos from past seasons. During the event I became a little confused on whether the singers in the photos were singing; I was hoping for more new video content, as there was only one recital shot of resident artist [Mia Athey](https://mnopera.org/biography/mia-athey/) singing a selection from the new opera _Blue_, which was set to be produced at Minnesota Opera in March with singers who originated roles. (_Blue_ is set to play at the Washington National Opera in July 2021.)

"We will trust you as our leader" from Scott Joplin's 1911 opera _Treemonisha_ (also referred to as a ragtime opera) juxtaposed the traditional operatic sounds, in an arrangement performed by [The Steeles](https://first-avenue.com/performer/steeles). It was great to hear and learn about this work; of course, MN opera is known internationally for their focus on new works, and I hope they incorporate rediscovering and exposing old ones like _Treemonisha_.

It felt weird being surrounded by opera lovers (socially distanced, of course) just a few days after the Metropolitan Opera essentially "cancelled" live opera in North America until late September 2021 (or maybe winter of 2022?). Things haven't been super well in Europe, but I sincerely admire the attempts. As many others have pointed out, the Met's decision will have trickle-down effects for artistic administrators, orchestra and choir members, stage staff, and costume designers - the list could go on and on. I am surely not qualified to speculate where this will lead the industry in the country.

On the micro level, the Twin Cities has a thriving opera and theater community filled with small grassroots companies. I hope these companies survive and continue to engage their audiences until live performances are safe. When I attended a outdoor production in a rural part of Minnesota this summer, I never thought that we would be looking at another year (or years??) of no live theater.

Ugh - I donâ€™t want to end this on a pessimistic note. Kudos to Minnesota Opera for getting us all (safely!) out of our houses and allowing us to applaud and cheer artists together again.
