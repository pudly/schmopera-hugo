The [Free Concert Series](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries.aspx) in the Four Seasons Centre's Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre is winding down for the summer, and [this week marks the end](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries/May.aspx) of the Vocal Series performances. At noon this Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, you can catch some stellar singing, *for free*.

**Tuesday, May 19th:** Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova and pianist Rachel Andrist perform [*Songs of Love and Death*](http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/concert150519.pdf), a program of Tchaikovsky's *Three Songs* and Mussorgsky's chilling *Songs and Dances of Death*. If you've heard Ekaterina as Judith in the COC's *Bluebeard's Castle*, you know she's not one to be missed; if you haven't heard her, get thee to the Amphitheatre.

**Wednesday, May 20th:** Singers of the COC Ensemble Studio perform Janáček's [*The Diary of One Who Disappeared*](http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/concert150520.pdf). It's a great chance to catch up with tenor Owen McCausland, and hear Charlotte Burrage (fresh from her performance of Rosina with the COC's *The Barber of Seville*) in some entirely different music.

**Thursday, May 21st:** [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) is presenting a [preview](http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/concert150521.pdf) of their upcoming *Death & Desire*, which fuses together two densely expressive song cycles: Schubert's *Die Schöne Müllerin* and Messaien's *Harawi*. Stephen Hegedus sings selections of Schubert, and Krisztina Szabó shows off a taste of Messaien; at the piano will be AtG's Music Director, Christopher Mokrzewski.

Like I said, get thee to the Amphitheatre. The doors open at 11:30am all three days, and although seating goes fast, this venue has some of the best standing room around.
