We talked about the [San Diego Opera](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-san-diego-opera-emergency-fundraising-campaign-20140429,0,4964395.story#axzz30fJoWEHt) kerfuffle, about the [Metropolitan Opera Chorus](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/nyregion/asking-how-much-an-opera-singers-work-is-worth.html?_r=0), and what the arts are worth. It gets juicy, let me tell you. [Have a listen](http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1041022875001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAA8fYP8DE~,PwkmV6k8YkoszgaJmIokKckMGcHaVEzR&bctid=3531524163001)!
