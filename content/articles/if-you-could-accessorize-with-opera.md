short_description: Accessories designer Diana Broussard is introducing a new resin
  handbag this November. This doesn&#039;t seem like a topic worthy of an opera blog,
  but stay with me. The handbag comes equipped with an LCD screen, and wearers can
  play video and audio of their choice, whatever goes best with your outfit, I suppose.

Accessories designer [Diana Broussard](http://www.dianabroussard.com/?page=collection) is introducing a [new resin handbag](http://www.gramophone.co.uk/classical-music-news/new-handbag-plays-contemporary-classical-music) this November. This doesn't seem like a topic worthy of an opera blog, but stay with me. The handbag comes equipped with an LCD screen, and wearers can play video and audio of their choice, whatever goes best with your outfit, I suppose. The promotional video created for the the "dbCHRONICLE" clutch features American composer [David Lang](http://www.schmopera.com/in-review-the-whisper-opera/)'s *optimism*, performed by [So Percussion](http://sopercussion.com/), with motion graphics by Italian designer Giovanni Locantore. Have a look & listen:

Inevitably, I started cackling to myself about what videos (or audio only, if I prefer) I'd upload onto my new $1950 handbag with LCD screen. Probably a lot of "Quando m'en vo" from *La bohÃ¨me* for strutting around town, or maybe some "Je suis encor" (*Manon*) for when I visit new cities. There would have to be some "Ride of the Valkyries" for battling through rush-hour, but then I'd switch it up to the Brindisi from *La traviata* for happy hour.

Other opera accessories that could be hilarious:

- A wallet that plays the Page's aria from *Les Huguenots* (["Non, non, non, non, non"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY1vK4GCjKU)). The first few "nons" might help me think twice at checkout before buying something silly.
- An umbrella that plays ["Va! laisse couler me larmes!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2pr19p828) (*Werther*) so I can be dramatic on rainy days.
- Some shoes that work like those sneakers that light up, but instead they play the [Anvil Chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZN01_pAxro) to my walking tempo.

>Readers, share your must-have opera accessories. Technology is in play, the possibilities are endless!
