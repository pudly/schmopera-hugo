So thank you, readers and Facebook users, for giving us your thumbs up, be it virtual or literal. There are even more reasons to like Schmopera coming up in the next few weeks. We're redesigning the whole site to make it easier to find what you want, and of course, to keep it looking slick. We like to build anticipation in an Wagnerian fashion, so stay tuned for the big reveal. 

Thanks again, everyone, and be sure to tell your friends on Twitter to follow us [@Schmopera](https://twitter.com/Schmopera)!
