Next week, Ottawa theatre-lovers, you're in for a treat. Against the Grain Theatre's *#UncleJohn* is having its third run as part of the [Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival](http://www.chamberfest.com/). If you saw *#UncleJohn* in Toronto last season, you'd recognize the cast of singers:

- [Cameron McPhail](/scene/people/cameron-mcphail/) (Uncle John)
- [Neil Craighead](/scene/people/neil-craighead/) (Leporello)
- [Miriam Khalil](/scene/people/miriam-khalil/) (Elvira)
- [Betty Allison](/scene/people/betty-allison/) (Anna)
- [Sean Clark](/scene/people/sean-clark/) (Ottavio)
- [Sharleen Joynt](/scene/people/sharleen-joynt/) (Zerlina)
- [Aaron Durand](/scene/people/aaron-durand/) (Masetto)
- John Avey (The Commander)

Also heading to Canada's capital are the Cecilia String Quartet led by Music Director Miloš Repický. I was lucky enough to help out on the music end for a short while, a bizarre-in-a-great-way reunion of people and ideas. It's an impressive thing to watch such a strong cast reconvene; there's efficient work in a show-specific shorthand, but there are still questions about the space, the audience, the dialogue, all in the name of keeping *#UncleJohn* fresh.

Against the Grain Theatre is having its most exciting season yet, having just finished their workshop production of *A Little Too Cozy* at the Banff Centre, the third in Artistic Director Joel Ivany's trilogy of Mozart/Da Ponte "transladaptations" (preceded by *Figaro's Wedding* and *#UncleJohn*). 

If you're in the Ottawa area next week, you can catch one of three performances of *#UncleJohn*, August 3, 4 & 6 at Tabaret Hall, University of Ottawa. Follow the box office links below for more details.
