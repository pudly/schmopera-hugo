Alright, it's Monday, and we're going to jump right in with a personal list of things to catch in Toronto as the weather warms up over the next little while.

The University of Toronto Faculty of Music presents Benjamin Britten's [Albert Herring](http://www.music.utoronto.ca/events/calendar/opr0320.htm?ViewMode=View&DateTime=635309406000000000&PageMode=View), March 20-23rd at the MacMillan Theatre in the Edward Johnson Building. It's conducted by Leslie Dala, a cornerstone Canadian conductor, and directed by Joel Ivany, one of the brilliant minds behind [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/). _Albert Herring_ was the first production performed at the MacMillan Theatre 50 years ago, and so it's a timely return to one of my favourite operas. The show is double-cast, full of UofT students and a few guests, and seeing it twice might not be a bad idea. Tickets can be purchased by calling 416-408-0208, or online [here](http://performance.rcmusic.ca/event/university-toronto-faculty-music-presents-brbritten-albert-herring-2).

On April 5th, [Essential Opera](http://essentialopera.com/) presents a [triple-bill of new Canadian operas](http://essentialopera.com/new-works/). There's _Etiquette_, with music by Monica Pearce and libretto by the one and only John Terauds; _Regina_, composed by Elisha Denburg with libretto by Maya Rabinovitch; and finally _Heather (Cindy + Mindy = BFs 4ever)_, with music by Christopher Thornborrow and libretto by Julie Tepperman. This is a rare treat outside the walls of [Tapestry Opera](https://tapestryopera.com/), and I can't wait. The show is one night only, April 5, 2014, 8:00pm, Heliconian Hall, 35 Hazelton Lane. Details [here](http://essentialopera.com/new-works/).

Next up is [_Hänsel & Gretel_](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/), the Humperdinck favourite that gives me the creeps, presented by [Metro Youth Opera](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca). Metro Youth is direct in its objective: to give performance opportunities to young singers who need experience. That makes it a great company to support, so grab a ticket and go see opera's newest talent. It runs April 25-27th at the Aki Studio Theatre in the Daniels Spectrum Building, 585 Dundas East. To purchase tickets, click [here](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/).

Beginning April 5th, the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/) begins its Spring season with the much-anticipated production of Handel's [_Hercules_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/Hercules.aspx), directed by Peter Sellars. The cast includes Alice Coote and Eric Owens, and I blabbed on and on about it [here](http://schmopera.com/hercules-yes-please/). Go, go see it. Next up at the COC in the spring is Donizetti's _[Roberto Devereux](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/RobertoDevereux.aspx)_, opening April 25th. It's Sondra Radvanovsky and Russell Braun. Just go. And finally, the last of the COC's spring hat-trick is Massenet's [_Don Quichotte_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx), in which you can hear the venerable Ferruccio Furlanetto sing the lead role. Quinn Kelsey and Ekaterina Gubanova round out the lead cast, so it's safe to say the singing will be spectacular. _Quichotte_ opens May 9, 2014.
