With all our verbosity about opera, we'll admit we're a bit light on the topic of [Peking opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_opera). 

And if you're in the same boat, this weekend is a great chance to discover traditional opera, classical and folk music of China. 

On **December 2 and 3** at Toronto's Sony Centre, the Beijing-based [China Broadcasting Chinese Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Broadcasting_Chinese_Orchestra) presents *Enchanting China: Masterpieces of Chinese Music*, December 2 and 3 at the Sony Centre. The Orchestra is a major cultural symbol in China, with a history of over 50 years dedicated to the performance and recording of Chinese music on traditional instruments like pipas, bamboo flutes, erhus, and lion drums.

"Not unlike Canada, China is an immense country with many peoples and cultures scattered across its vastness," says Music Director Zhang Gaoxiang (via translator). "In *Enchanting China*, we share the voices of these many places and introduce Canadians to Chinese music's cultural richness. We hope Toronto will be intrigued to experience our country's version of the orchestra – and be spellbound by the music that it weaves."

Gaoxiang and the CBCO is joined by the [Ottawa Bach Choir](http://ottawabachchoir.ca/en/home/), Chinese fusion singer [Gong Linna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Linna), and yet-unnamed "special Canadian guest singers". The programme is a line-up of Chinese classical music, folk music, Peking opera, [Kunqu opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunqu), and traditional Chinese dance.
