short_description: American singer Jennifer Holloway is currently in Toronto, all
  set to make her Canadian Opera Company debut as Donna Elvira in Dmitri Tcherniakov&#039;s
  production of Don Giovanni, which opens January 24th. She was kind enough to sit
  down with me and talk about the character of Donna Elvira, about sympathizing with
  the Don, and about Mozart&#039;s sense of feminism.

American singer [Jennifer Holloway](http://www.jenniferhollowaymezzo.com/jenniferhollowaymezzo.com/Home.html) is currently in Toronto, all set to make her Canadian Opera Company debut as Donna Elvira in Dmitri Tcherniakov's [Don Giovanni](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DonGiovanni.aspx), which opens January 24th. She was kind enough to sit down with me and talk about the character of Donna Elvira, about sympathizing with the Don, and about Mozart's sense of feminism. She's delightful and smart, and I can't wait to hear her on the Four Seasons Centre stage. Enjoy!
