[Esprit Orchestra](/scene/companies/esprit-orchestra/), a Canadian leader in new orchestra music, launches its new season this week with the first of five concerts, all packed with new and brand new works.

On **October 24, 8pm**, Esprit's cosmos-themed season opener is titled [*For Orbiting Spheres*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/for-orbiting-spheres/), named after the first piece on the programme by American composer Missy Mazzoli (*Proving Up*, *Breaking the Waves*). Mazzoli's work gets its Canadian premiere along with Unsuk Chin's *Chorós Chordón*, and Tristan Keuris' *Sinfonia*.

**November 28, 8pm** is [*North/White*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/north-white/), a programme that includes work by Canadian favourite Alexina Louie, Icelandic composer Anna Thorvaldsdottir's *Dreaming*. The concert gets its name from the work by R. Murray Schafer, who in a depiction of the dichotomy between Arctic beauty and environmental destruction, places a snowmobile in the percussion section. Yes, a snowmobile. "I decided to place a snowmobile in the percussion section as a symbol of noise and pollution generated by technology," Schafer clarifies.

On **January 20, 8pm**, Esprit's [*Constellations*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/constellations/) concert will mark the opening of the University of Toronto New Music Festival. On the programme are works by Toshio Hosokawa and Alison Yun-Fei Jiang, Claude Vivier's *Orion*, and the world premiere of Christopher Goddard's *Les tringles des sistres tintaient* (a re-imagining of the Act II opening of Bizet's *Carmen*).

Esprit's 2018/19 season closes on **March 24, 8pm**, with [*Grand Slam!*](https://www.espritorchestra.com/concert-tickets/concert/grand-slam/) Joseph Johnson, principal cellist of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, plays Unsuk Chin's *Cello Concerto*, and Esprit's principal percussionist Ryan Scott performs Maki Ishii's *Afro Concerto*. The concert also features the world premiere of Canadian composer Christopher Thornborrow's *Trompe l'oeil*.

Esprit Orchestra is also relaunching its New Wave Festival, originally established in 2002. On **April 5, 7:30pm**, *New Wave Reprise* features six world premieres by emerging Canadian composers.

The four mainstage concerts of Esprit Orchestra's 2018/19 season happen at Toronto's Koerner Hall at 8pm. Pre-concert chats happen at 7:15pm, moderated by Alexina Louie. *New Wave Reprise* goes up at Trinity St. Paul's Centre, with John Rea as keynote speaker.
