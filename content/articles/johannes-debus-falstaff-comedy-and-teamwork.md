short_description: I caught up with Johannes Debus, Music Director of the Canadian
  Opera Company, between performances of the current (and spectacular!) production
  of Verdi’s Falstaff. He was kind enough to talk about what it’s like to conduct
  a piece like Falstaff, and how teamwork can amount to fantastic comedy. Maestro
  Debus even gives us a taste of fun things to come in the COC’s 2014/15,like the
  famed Robert LePage double-bill of Schoenberg’s Erwartung and Bartók’s Bluebeard’s
  Castle in May.

I caught up with [Johannes Debus](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx), Music Director of the Canadian Opera Company, between performances of the current (and spectacular!) production of Verdi's _[Falstaff](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/Falstaff.aspx)_. He was kind enough to talk about what it's like to conduct a piece like _Falstaff_, and how teamwork can amount to fantastic comedy. Maestro Debus even gives us a taste of fun things to come in the COC's 2014/15, including his first [_Die Walküre_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DieWalkure.aspx) in January, and the famed [Robert LePage double-bill](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Subscriptions/1415DigitalBrochure/discover-the-season/Bluebeard.aspx) of Schoenberg's _Erwartung_ and Bartók's _Bluebeard's Castle_ in May. Enjoy!
