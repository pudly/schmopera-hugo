It's true! If you're a fan of *Star Trek*, you're well aware of the Klingon culture's appreciation for opera. [*'u'*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%99u%E2%80%99), the so-called "First authentic Klingon opera on Earth" by Eef van Breen, Kees Ligtelijn, and Marc Okrand, was put up in 2010 in The Hague to sold-out crowds.

Though it may not be for everyone, there's a new Klingon opera in the works, thanks to YouTube user [PDXVoiceTeacher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGUEB5QsZ-t41sx_lvzYTfA).

PDXVoiceTeacher has released samples of the themes he's created so far:

It's not yet sounding like much except for a cool, evocative colour that makes us think of big caves, maybe some scary alien species, and a bit of *Game of Thrones*. But hey, if a Klingon opera ever comes to our neighbourhood, we'll be there with bells on.

Also, here's the Queen of the Night's famous aria from *The Magic Flute* - in Klingon!
