As usual at Schmopera, May was a month of talking about tools for singers, and how they market themselves. Using social media, building your website, and re-thinking how to bridge the language gap with your audience during recitals.

We also discussed what arts companies are doing for their artists, and how a small budget and too few people can affect the working environment for young singers and pianists.

I also went to that one opera party that inspired me to write about the weird world of philanthropy as a young, broke, eager artist. Does my neurotic party monologue sound similar to yours?
