  I was watching Freddie Mercury videos earlier today, in research for [my recent post](/why-directing-opera-is-like-directing-music-videos-sort-of/) about music videos and opera. So, I just want to make sure everyone has seen this. Freddie Mercury sings "Barcelona" with Montserrat Caballé, released in 1988. It's [not their first collaboration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CjUvbSjyPY), either. Freddie looks so dapper, and Monserrat is hamming it up. I love it.

  Also, don't forget Queen and Pavarotti singing "[Too Much Love Will Kill You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CjUvbSjyPY)."
