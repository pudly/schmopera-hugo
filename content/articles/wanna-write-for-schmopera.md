Alright, readers, listen up: Schmopera is on the hunt for guest contributors!

We want to keep a two-way conversation with the people making opera happen today, and that means hearing from more voices - like yours. We're looking for reviewers, opinion havers, and those willing to send us stories from inside the opera beast. 

If you're eager to write, and have your apostrophes in order, we want to hear from you.

Get in touch atÂ [us@schmopera.com](mailto:us@schmopera.com), and tell us about yourself!
