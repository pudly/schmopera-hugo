The [announcement](https://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/open-space-opera-21st-century) is out, and it's official: [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/) will spend a third summer at [The Banff Centre](/scene/companies/the-banff-centre/), for [*Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century*](https://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/open-space-opera-21st-century), a program in partnership with the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/). 

*Open Space* is noticeably forward-thinking in its approach to training young artists. 13 young singers, 1 assistant director, and 1 assistant répétiteur will be selected for 5 weeks of music and staging rehearsals, lessons, coachings, and performance opportunities within the Banff community. "The focus of Open Space is to impart the skills of tomorrow to the young opera professionals of today." In a recent [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/the-banff-centre/opera-in-canada_b_8691748.html) for Huff Post, Against the Grain Artistic Director [Joel Ivany](/scene/people/joel-ivany/) wrote, "In just two years, I believe this program has shown Canada (and the opera industry) an alternative. It has become a place of excitement, development, and collaboration." 

In 2014, *Open Space* brought the first production of *#UncleJohn*, the second in AtG's Mozart/Ivany trilogy of "transladaptations", preceded by *Figaro's Wedding* in 2013. The program expanded the following year, to include a staged concert of chamber music directed by Joel Ivany and [Amiel Gladstone](/scene/people/amiel-gladstone/), as well as two productions: James Rolfe and Anna Chatterton's [*Crush*](https://www.banffcentre.ca/articles/sex-clubs-and-reality-tv-opera-21st-century), and [*A Little Too Cozy*](https://www.banffcentre.ca/articles/behind-scenes-reality-show-opera-little-too-cozy), the final Mozart/Ivany piece, based on *Così fan tutte*.

In June and July 2016, AtG, the COC, and The Banff Centre collaborate on two productions, and a staged presentation of 20th and 21st century vocal chamber music. Scottish director Paul Curren directs Britten's *The Rape of Lucretia*, conducted by AtG Music Director and Calgary Opera Resident Concuctor [Topher Mokrzewski](/scene/people/christopher-mokrzewski/), and Joel Ivany directs *Three Weddings and a Funeral!*, a #MozartMurderMystery, conducted by Miloš Repický. I don't know about you, readers, but all of that sounds like an exciting summer.

The faculty at *Open Space* will be impressive, as usual, including Alexander Neef, COC General Director, Canadian baritone Russell Braun, and star soprano Adrianne Pieczonka. No doubt there will be more to announce in the coming months, so [stay tuned](https://twitter.com/AtGtheatre).

\*Bonus info you can't yet get on their website: yours truly will be heading out west once again, to join the music staff for *Open Space* 2016. We'll introduce you to the artists, and bring you behind-the-scenes with some of Canada's most exciting  developments in opera. (To get caught up, check out the Related Articles links below.)
