Hello, Schmop-Tops!

This Sunday, September 25th at 2pm, the [Confidential Opera Project](https://www.facebook.com/events/180644475692691/) returns with its second instalment. 

After an incredibly successful first show in June, we are #stokedissimo to bring you another one of the opera world's most beloved works, sung by some of the best up-and-coming talent here in Toronto. 

Our debut show, Mozart's *Die Zauberflöte*, was a huge success. With singers like [Teiya Kasahara](/scene/people/teiya-kasahara/) in the role of the Queen of the Night, Erin Stone's hilarious portrayal of Pamina, [Aaron Durand](/talking-with-singers-aaron-durand/)'s moving Papageno and rising star tenor [Asitha Tennekoon](/scene/people/asitha-tennekoon/)'s beautiful Tamino (just to name a few) the audience was delighted at every turn.

This time around, it's no different. The cast is stellar, the piece is one of our favourites, and it's a great way to kick off the fall season of opera here in #the6ix. 

With musical direction by the incomparable Jennifer Tung, we are certain you'll be transported to another time and place to be entertained like never before.

We hope you'll join us and experience the magic as it happens, live and unrehearsed, at the beautiful Gallery 345, 345 Sorauren Avenue, Toronto. This venue is fast becoming one of the city's best places to see and hear classical music. 

Tickets are $25 a piece and are [available here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/confidential-opera-project-toronto-tickets-27744828529). Get yours now and [#BeInOnTheSecret](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/confidential-opera-project-toronto-tickets-27744828529). 

See you there!
