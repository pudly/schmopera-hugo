Everyone, meet [Miriam Khalil](https://twitter.com/SongbirdKhalil). She's a Lebanese-Canadian soprano currently based in Toronto, and she'll be singing in _Uncle John_, as everyone's favourite clingy chick, Elvira. Miriam took time to share her thoughts on her role, the _Uncle John_ [project](http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1457), and singing in Banff.

You can find more info about _Uncle John_ at [The Banff Centre](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/) and [Against the Grain Theatre](https://www.facebook.com/AtGtheatre).
