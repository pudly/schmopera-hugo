short_description: '&quot;Once I became comfortable with my ability as an opera singer,
  once I got to the point where I felt immersed in the form, then I began to question
  the form itself,&quot; says Bickersteth. &quot;I started to wonder how I, as a black
  person singing white European roles from another era, connect personally to this
  art form. It became problematic to connect with what I was trained to sing. I love
  the music, but I began to feel constricted in my expression of it. I began to look
  for other ways to fuse my training and love of classical music, with my dawning
  awareness of other modes of expression.&quot;'

Over at the Crow's Theatre until **April 29**, you can catch [*Century Song*](http://www.nightwoodtheatre.net/index.php/whats_on/century_song), the fascinating "live performance hybrid" created by soprano Neema Bickersteth that "melds classical song and movement to inhabit a century of Canadian women."

Bickersteth is a magnetic performer with a striking poise about her work; *Century Song* has toured successfully throughout Canada and Europe, and it's currently in the middle of a limited run in Toronto, presented by Nightwood Theatre.

She collaborates with two Dora award-winners, choreographer Kate Alton and director Ross Manson, for a unique performance that features music by Rachmaninoff, Messaien, Geroges Aperghis and Toronto's Reza Jacobs. Projections by Germany's [fettFilm](http://www.fettfilm.com/de/index.html) bring to life extraordinary visuals, inspired by major art movements of the 20th century.

"Once I became comfortable with my ability as an opera singer, once I got to the point where I felt immersed in the form, then I began to question the form itself," says Bickersteth. "I started to wonder how I, as a black person singing white European roles from another era, connect personally to this art form. It became problematic to connect with what I was trained to sing. I love the music, but I began to feel constricted in my expression of it. I began to look for other ways to fuse my training and love of classical music, with my dawning awareness of other modes of expression."
