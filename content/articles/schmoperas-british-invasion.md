Readers, we've a big announcement to make!

Schmopera is relocating, and starting in February, we'll be based out of London, England. We're beyond excited to get our feet wet in the City's opera scene, and to expand as often as possible to Berlin, Paris, Zürich, Barcelona, Amsterdam, and every other opera house with an airport or train station nearby. From our London base, we'll maintain our status quo of artist interviews, show reviews, and writings on the hot opera topics across the pond. 

We're excited to meet new artists from new countries, and we're particularly looking forward to connecting with the slew of Canadians working among opera and classical music circles in Europe, seeing them onstage, and talking with them about the work abroad. 

Of course, we'll continue to keep you in the loop with the operatic goings-on in North America, and since Schmopera is Canadian at heart, we'll keep a special place on our blog for Canada's creative work.

Readers, if you're in the London area, and you know of an artist we should meet or a show we should see (or you *are* an artist and you're *in* a show we should see), please [get in touch](mailto:hello@schmopera.com)! We can't wait to connect.
