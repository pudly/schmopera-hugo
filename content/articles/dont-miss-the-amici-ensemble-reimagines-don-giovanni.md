On **February 19, 3pm** at Mazzoleni Hall on Bloor Street, the [Amici Chamber Ensemble](http://amiciensemble.com/event/don-giovanni-reimagined/) continues its season with a night of Mozart, with a twist.

Amici welcomes baritone [Aaron Durand](/talking-with-singers-aaron-durand/), mezzo-soprano [Beste Kalender](/scene/people/beste-kalender/), and wind players from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra for a programme of Mozart's Fantasy in D Minor for Solo Piano, his Quintet for Piano and Winds, and a rare version of his famed opera, *Don Giovanni*.

Insiring the concert's title, *Don Giovanni Reimagined*, the Amici ensemble presents [Josef Triebensee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Triebensee)'s arrangement; the Bohemian oboist and composer reduced Mozar'ts opera, scoring it for a chamber ensemble of wind instruments, and enough singers to cover the [short selection of numbers](http://amiciensemble.com/event/don-giovanni-reimagined/) from the opera. 
 
Tickets for *Don Giovanni Reimagined* start at just $10. You can find out more [right here](http://amiciensemble.com/event/don-giovanni-reimagined/), or [grab your tickets here](http://performance.rcmusic.ca/tickets/seats/11003).
