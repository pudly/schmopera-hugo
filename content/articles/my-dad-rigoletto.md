Today, readers, is my lovely father's 60th birthday! Over the years, he has become a big fan of live music; he may jokingly argue that it was against his will, but he never balked at the chance to hear me play, I know that. 

This duet from Act II of *Rigoletto* does not accurately reflect my relationship with my father (thank Dio!), but I can identify with a dad who who cares enormously for his daughter. Ileana Cotrubas and Cornell MacNeil sing "Tutte le feste al tempio" with James Levine in 1977. Piangi, indeed.

Happy birthday, Dad!
