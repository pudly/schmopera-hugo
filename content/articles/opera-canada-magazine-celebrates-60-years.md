When founding editor Ruby Mercer launched [_Opera Canada_](https://operacanada.ca/) magazine in February 1960, it was little more than a humble 4-page, 8 ½ X 11 newsletter. 60 years later, it is Canada's oldest, continuously published arts journal, and to celebrate, _Opera Canada_ recently released a 60th anniversary collector's edition to commemorate this landmark milestone. The lavish, 96-page special edition looks back at Canada's rich opera heritage but significantly, from the point of view of today’s leading, as well as up-and-coming Canadian opera artists.

The backbone of the anniversary issue is a series of six in-depth conversations between Canada’s next generation of opera stars and legendary greats who run the gamut from singers like [Judith Forst](/an-interview-with-judith-forst/) and [Wallis Giunta](https://youtu.be/tpV1U6Tb2dA) to stage and costume designers Susan Benson and Camellia Koo. The feature "Where is Black Opera in Canada" looks at Canadian contralto Portia White, and the historic lack of visibility of Black opera singers in Canada. The magazine's writers give insights on their greatest Canadian opera moments, young singers nominate an "opera icon" hall of fame and industry insiders offer their predictions for the art form's future.
