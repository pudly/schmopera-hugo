The [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/) has announced its season line-up for 2017/18, along with additional exciting news about the year to come.

Perhaps the most surprising announcement is the appointment of Canadian soprano [Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) as the COC's new Artist-In-Residence. Archibald sings leading roles in three of the company's mainstage productions next season, including two role debuts. She'll also perform in the Free Concert Series in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre at the Four Seasons Centre, and she'll work as a mentor to the members of the COC Ensemble Studio and the Orchestra Academy. Archibald, with her own professional schedule and her experience working on both sides of the Atlantic, is a savvy, relevant resource for the young artists of the COC. Exciting stuff.

Speaking of the Ensemble Studio, three new incoming artists have been officially selected from the extraordinary talent across Canada. Mezzo-soprano [Simone McIntosh](/scene/people/simone-mcintosh/), baritone [Samuel Chan](/scene/people/samuel-chan/), and pianist [Rachael Kerr](/scene/people/racheal-kerr/) are set to join the coveted young artists programme in the fall of 2017. Graduating from the programme are tenors [Charles Sy](/scene/people/charles-sy/), [Aaron Sheppard](/scene/people/aaron-sheppard/), and [Hyejin Kwon](/scene/people/hyejin-kwon/).

A departure from the trend of past seasons, where the artists of the COC Ensemble are featured in a special performance of a mainstage production on the Four Seasons Centre stage, the COC also announces *An Evening with the Ensemble Studio*, **May 25, 2018**. The young artists will perform in operatic scenes, conducted by COC Music Director [Johannes Debus](/scene/people/johannes-debus/) and joined by the COC Orchestra. Though it's not quite the same as seeing the young artists in a living production, a gala/scenes evening is likely a chance to hear a good cross-section of the young artists, where they can show off what they do best.

And now, the shows! In chronological order:

## *Arabella*

Richard Strauss' *Arabella* kicks off the fall of 2017. Tim Albery's production, co-produced with the COC, [Minnesota Opera](/scene/companies/minnesota-opera/), and [Santa Fe Opera](/scene/companies/santa-fe-opera/), comes to the Four Seasons Centre for the first time. The wonderful Patrick Lange conducts a stellar cast; Canadian sopranos [Erin Wall](/scene/people/erin-wall/) and [Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) sing Arabella and her mysterious sister, Zdenka. Tomasz Konieczny sings Mandryka, and David Pomeroy is Matteo. Performances run **October 5-28, 2017**.

## *The Elixir of Love*

James Robinson directs a new production of Donizetti's adorable *Elixir of Love*, co-produced with the COC, San Francisco Opera, Kansas City Opera, and Colorado Opera. An exciting cast of rising stars includes [Simone Osborne](/talking-with-singers-simone-osborne/) as Adina, and [Andrew Haji](/scene/people/andrew-haji/) as Nemorino. [Gordon Bintner](/scene/people/gordon-bintner/) sings the role of Belcore (he and Osborne are also newly married, so it's super cute), and [Andrew Shore](/scene/people/andrew-shore/) sings Doctor Dulcamara. Toronto-born Yves Abel conducts. Performances run **October 11 to November 4, 2017**.

## *Rigoletto*

Verdi's score is in excellent hands with maestro [Stephen Lord](/scene/people/stephen-lord/), who conducts Roland Wood in the title role, [Anna Christy](/scene/people/anna-christy/) as Gilda, and [Stephen Costello](/scene/people/stephen-costello/) as the Duke of Mantua.

## *The Abduction from the Seraglio*

[Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) returns to the Four Season Centre to sing Konstanze in Mozart's *The Abduction from the Serail*. Wajdi Mouawad's production with the COC and Opéra de Lyon also features [Mauro Peter](/scene/people/mauro-peter/) as Belmonte, and COC Ensemble Studio graduates [Claire de Sévigné](/claire-de-sevigne-sing-fast-high/) as Blonde and [Owen McCausland](/spotlight-on-owen-mccausland/) as Pedrillo. COC Music Director [Johannes Debus](/scene/people/johannes-debus/) conducts the performances, running **February 7-24, 2017**.

## *The Nightingale and Other Short Fables*

Robert Lepage's dazzling production of Stravinksy's *The Nightingale and Other Short Fables* sold out in its 2009 premiere run, and from **April 13 to May 19, 2017** it returns to the Four Season Centre stage. The co-production with Festival d'Aix-en-Provence, Opéra de Lyon and Ex Machina stars [Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) as the Nightingale, [Owen McCausland](/spotlight-on-owen-mccausland/) as the Fisherman, [Christian Van Horn](/talking-with-singers-christian-van-horn/) as the Emperor, and [Meredith Arwardy](/scene/people/meredith-arwardy/) as Death. Performers in *Nightingale* manipulate puppets designed by the Tony and Emmy award-winning Michael Curry. COC Music Director [Johannes Debus](/scene/people/johannes-debus/) conducts.
