Now, I'm not saying you _can't_ get a [good workout while listening to opera](/the-opera-workout/) -- but I'll admit that it's not my go-to when I'm trying to get sweaty.

I know it's fun for plenty of critics to make it seem like they're so loyal to their opera and classical music beats that they lift to Wagner's _Ride of the Valkyries_ or spin to Ravel's _Bolero_. But despite my utter love for Wagner and Ravel and all the late-greats, I just can't make myself be that consistent in my listening. (Although I will recommend yoga to Glass, and I've found that Prokofiev's Piano Concertos are a solidly weird way to pump yourself up.)

So, I work out to pop music. Like, the poppiest pop music that ever topped the pop charts. All the Lady Gaga, all the Beyonc√©, Katy Perry doing whatever, "Despacito" remixes, Pitbull, Lizzo, Macklemore, Rihanna, Skrillex, all of it.

(And yes, I am absolutely up for suggestions from you, readers, because I'm a 38-year-old woman and apparently no longer capable of discovering new music that's not already been out for several years. I joined the "All About That Bass" trend in 2019.)

Anyway. The cool thing about being an over-educated musician listening to pop music while on a runner's high is that you can do what I call varsity-level listening. It just means that compared to how the average person who didn't do two degrees in Western classical music, you're listening to music with more tools in your ears.
