New York Opera Alliance (NYOA) began the first leg of its plan to bring opera concerts to all five boroughs of New York City. They are one fifth of the way there, having completed a concert on April 22nd in the historic Bronx House on Pelham Parkway in the East Bronx. Seven opera companies from NYOAâ€™s fifty company membership, performed arias and duets from familiar operas and from some upcoming productions which are part of the NYOANext! Festival. The small but appreciative crowd heard familiar excerpts from Verdi and Gounod, as well as lesser-known pieces and even some new work.
