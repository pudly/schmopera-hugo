Toronto-based composer [Chris Thornborrow](/scene/people/chris-thornborrow/) is bringing his work and experience with young musicians to the Canadian Opera Company's Summer Opera Camp this July. Chris will help a group of young opera-philes to create their own original story and music. I asked him how he does it, and what he likes about working with young people.
