## 1. How did you settle on a project meant to be gifted to new parents and babies at hospitals and shelters?

I had heard about a similar project organized by one of our CCOC Honorary Patrons, TSO Maestro Peter Oundjian, who is also Music Director/Conductor with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.  They recorded lullabies and offered the CDs to new mothers & babies.  I immediately recognized that the CCOC could do the same, but we could take it a step further by actually singing texts from many different countries, thereby reflecting the cultural diversity of Toronto.

## 2. How did you go about collecting these lullabies?

It was such fun collecting the lullabies and doing the research.  We ended up with 17 tracks and singing in 12 different languages.  Some of the songs were ones that I had sung as a soprano soloist, others were already in the repertoire of the CCOC, and then I asked for suggestions from the choristers, and two songs were suggested by parents.  I am pleased with the variety and the CD features the Principal and Youth Choruses, alumni soloists, staff, and one musician-parent.  So, you will hear choruses, soloists, added instrumentalists, and a few new arrangements.

## 3. What sort of reaction or feedback have you gotten from members of the CCOC about working on Lullabies, and its CD release?

I think the choristers are very proud of the CD and eager to share it with new mothers & babies.  We are excited to have a launch and to showcase a couple of the songs, so there is some buzz around this.  The response from organizations has been quite wonderful and the new Artistic Director, Dean Burry, has planned the event in a very appropriate venue.  I have recently retired, but this seems to be a great parting “musical gift”.
