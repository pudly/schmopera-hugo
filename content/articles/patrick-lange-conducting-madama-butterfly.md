short_description: I had the chance to sit down with maestro Patrick Lange, currently
  in town to conduct Madama Butterfly at the Canadian Opera Company. The Berlin-based
  conductor is in the middle of the twelve-show run featuring two different casts,
  and he still found time to do things like run in the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront
  Marathon and answer some of my questions.
