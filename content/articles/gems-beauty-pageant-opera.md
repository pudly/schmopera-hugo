preamble: "It's rare, but I just love it when it happens: beauty pageant opera. \n\nIt
  usually happens one of two ways for me: predictably not great, or surprisingly good.
  When I'm listening to the former, I'm wondering how they picked their aria, trying
  to hear their singing background in their sound, all very judgy things that I scold
  myself over almost immediately. When I hear something surprisingly good, I start
  listening for *fach*-isms, imaginging operatic roles for her voice, and wondering
  to myself: by being sceptical of her singing, maybe I was part of the problem with
  the whole pageant stereotype.\n\nAnyway. Here's newly crowned Miss America Betty
  Cantrell (Miss Georgia, 2015) singing \"Tu? tu? piccolo iddio!\" from *Madama Butterfly*
  in last weekend's Miss America 2016. For some reason I wouldn't have thought of
  this aria as a good TV pick, but it packs a punch out of context, musically if not
  dramatically; and her opera-scene-slash-beauty-pageant staging is entertaining.
  Plus, she adds a little surprise at the end.\n\nMore beauty pageant opera, one surprisingly
  good, the other predictably not great:\n\n- [Miss America 2012: Laura Kaeppeler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL2sFdlUK40)
  (Miss Wisconsin) singing Luigi Arditi's *Il bacio*.\n- [Miss America 2014: Theresa
  Vail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GojUwW6voyA) (Miss Kansas), singing \"Nessun
  dorma.\""
