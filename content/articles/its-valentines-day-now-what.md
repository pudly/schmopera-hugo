I thought about making a flow chart for Valentine's Day. It was going to be sort of like If-You're-Single-Do-This and If-You're-Attached-Do-This. But the answer to both is the same, making this a very simplistic flow chart indeed.

Watch _[La bohème](http://whatshouldwecallopera.tumblr.com/post/48698251061/the-end-of-la-boheme)._

It's great for cherry-picking. You can cry over the cute bonnet Rodolfo bought, or you can be glad you don't have a Musetta on your hands, or you can just forget about Valentine's Day altogether and watch some good opera. Box of chocolates unnecessary, but probably a great idea.
