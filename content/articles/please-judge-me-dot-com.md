[Mark Joelson Daboll ](http://www.pleasejudgeme.com/judge-team.html)is a Toronto-based voice teacher, and he just innovated The Voice Lesson. Mark is the creator of [PleaseJudgeMe.com](http://www.pleasejudgeme.com/home.html), which offers professional feedback on video submissions from aspiring singers. The PJM team advises submitters on everything from picking out repertoire to vocal warm-ups, and it's an anonymous, low-pressure way to try out audition repertoire. I chatted with Mark about why he's crazy for teaching voice, how singers can use PleaseJudgeMe.com, and about the upcoming [#7SecondSelfie Singing Contest](http://www.pleasejudgeme.com/7secondselfie.html) (you could win an iPad mini!).

Follow PleaseJudgeMe on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_PleaseJudgeMe) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PleaseJudgeMe), and enter the [#7SecondSelfie Singing Contest](http://www.pleasejudgeme.com/7secondselfie.html) by September 29th!
