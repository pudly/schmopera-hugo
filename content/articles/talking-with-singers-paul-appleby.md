American tenor [Paul Appleby](/scene/people/paul-appleby/) recently finished a run of Belmonte in [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/companies/the-metropolitan-opera/)'s production of *Die Entführung aus dem Serail*, and he heads next to the Glyndebourne Festival, to sing the title role in Berlioz's *Béatrice et Bénédict*. Paul is one of those thoughtful, curious artists who craves the stage as a [recitalist](http://www.schmopera.com/paul-appleby-telling-stories-at-wigmore-hall/) as well as in operatic roles.

He spoke to us from New York, about his return to the Glyndebourne Festival, about Berlioz's Bénédict and the qualities he shares with stand-up comedians, and about being a part of maestro James Levine's final performance as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera.
