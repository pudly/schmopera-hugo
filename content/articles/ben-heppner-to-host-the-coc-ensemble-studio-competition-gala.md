Photo: Michael Cooper</div> On November 25th, the Canadian Opera Company will present the second annual [Centre Stage: Ensemble Studio Competition Gala](http://coccentrestage.ca/). The best of Canada's young opera scene will sing for the chance to win some prize money ($1500-$5000), and they'll also be vying for a spot in the [COC Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx). The Ensemble Studio "is Canada's premier training program for young opera professionals", and as an alumna myself, I have such a soft spot in my heart for all the competitors. It's a big deal for these singers to sing on the Four Seasons Centre stage, with the COC Orchestra under Music Director [Johannes Debus](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx).
Also a big deal: celebrated Canadian tenor and host of the [CBC](http://music.cbc.ca/#!/Saturday-Afternoon-at-the-Opera)'s _Saturday Afternoon at the Opera_ [Ben Heppner](http://www.benheppner.com/) will host! Beautiful. Says COC General Director Alexander Neef, "given his personal connection to the Ensemble Studio as one of its early graduates, [Ben] is the ideal ambassador to help introduce to our_ Centre Stage_ patrons some of the best new opera talent from across the country."

Auditions for finalists are already happening in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and New York. Come see the final round in gala-style on November 25th! For full details and to purchase tickets for the Ensemble Studio Competition Gala, [click here](http://coccentrestage.ca/).
