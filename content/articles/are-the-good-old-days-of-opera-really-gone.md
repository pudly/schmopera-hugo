Are the good old days really gone?

The boardroom tables, lunch rooms and hallways of any classical music organization in Canada, not to mention social media, have been abuzz with chatter over [Vancouver Opera](/scene/companies/vancouver-opera/)'s recent announcement. Most of the details do not bear repeating here. What was once a full opera season has now been curtailed into a festival of dubiously brief duration. This decision was portrayed by the company to be one of vision, forward thinking, a demonstration of adaptability in a changing landscape. To most of us, in our heart of hearts, and to some who said so publicly, it was an admission of defeat. One of Canada's major opera companies will cease to function as a major opera company should, strictly speaking. The good old days are gone.

Ah, but wait. "Not so", said many. On Facebook and Twitter many of my colleagues shared the Vancouver news with a kind of mock positivity; in fact, their fear was palpable. And why not? 
Their livelihoods, indeed those of countless professional singers, and soon to be professional singers, instrumentalists, directors, conductors and administrators who make art in this country are in jeopardy. 

Alas, Vancouver Opera's news is bad news, plain and simple. I think we all know it. A few of the brave, those not forced to adhere to the party line out of fear for their current and future employment, said so publicly. I was disappointed to see the eminent Vancouver Symphony music director and tireless arts advocate, Bramwell Tovey, raked over the coals by some for his very natural expression of disappointment on Twitter. A person so passionate about the state of the art in his adopted city and indeed in this land, has a right to be concerned. Since that tweet, Maestro Tovey has released a finely crafted and well argued article of support for Vancouver Opera in  *The Globe and Mail*. It's a wonderful bit of writing that compels us to reflection. You can read it [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/now-is-the-time-to-support-vancouver-opera/article25032174/).

In addition to clarifying his own personal views on the matter, I was interested to read Maestro Tovey's views on the manner in which Vancouver Opera's decision was portrayed in their media announcement. Characterizing it as spin, Tovey's most compelling statement indicated that the kind of double speak Vancouver Opera perhaps practiced in this instance jeopardized relations with their donors. I do believe it, as Paul Simon sang, I do believe it's true. But this very fact, that a company experiencing hard times, as so many arts organizations do, and so pivots drastically in a new direction for the sake of survival, ought and must necessarily be embraced by all of us in the arts community. We have no choice.

The good old days are gone. 

Amongst ourselves and out in the world, there is a broader discussion that continues regarding the state of the arts in North America (mostly bad, depressing, sob about it) and what to do about it (defend against the encroaching darkness). There is concern, there is fear. There is also anger and resentment and a great deal of defensive action and reactionary behaviour. Some wonder by what means the good old days came to be these not so good days, and if there are people to be blamed. But let's just leave that for the time being. The situation remains and looking backward at it will not do much good. 

The good old days are gone.

> Post script: To employ one of my favourite lines by another great songwriter (this time Billy Joel), "the good old times weren't always good and tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems".
