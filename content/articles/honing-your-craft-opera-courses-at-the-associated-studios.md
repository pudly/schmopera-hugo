The [8-week course](http://www.associatedstudios.co.uk/event/8-week-opera-course-focusing-on-french-and-english-opera/) has a focus on French and English opera, and classes include Pilates, acting, French language, solo repertoire, ensemble repertoire, and performance classes with répétiteurs and directors. The course runs November 24-February 3; the audition application deadline is this week, but Associate Studios keeps waitlist, and there may be flexibility if you're quick.
