On December 8, 2016 the *New York Times* [reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/arts/music/dmitri-hvorostovsky-citing-brain-tumor-withdraws-from-opera.html?_r=0) that Russian baritone (and heartthrob) [Dmitri Hvorostovksy](/scene/people/dmitri-hvorostovsky/) will be withdrawing from operatic performances for the "foreseeable future".

After the discovery of a brain tumor in 2015, and taking a break to deal with his health last summer, he returned to the opera and recital stage to great reviews. Anthony Tommasini from the *Times* noted from Hvorostovsky's appearance in *Il Trovotore* at the Metropolitan Opera that his "resplendent voice, with its distinctive mellow character and dusky veneer, sounded not at all compromised."

In statement released across social media and his artist's website, Hvorostovsky writes on his Facebook page:

*"To all my friends, fans and colleagues:*

*"It is with great sadness that I must withdraw from opera performances for the foreseeable future. I have been experiencing balance issues associated with my illness, making it extremely difficult for me to perform in staged productions.
I will continue to give concerts and recitals as well as make recordings. Singing is my life, and I want to continue bringing joy to people worldwide.
With this pause in my operatic career and more rest in between each engagement, I hope to have more time to focus on my health and treatment.
Thank you for all your love, messages and well wishes. Your support is felt and means the world to me.*

*"With love,*

*Dmitri Hvorostovsky."*

Our thoughts here at Schmopera go out Mr. Hvorostovsky and his family, and we hope for a speedy recovery.
