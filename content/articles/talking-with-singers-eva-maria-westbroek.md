### Why do you sing professionally?

I feel the luckiest person in the world to sing and be surrounded by music and inspiring people, and to make a living on top of that!

### What kind of woman is Liza in _The Queen of Spades_?

I think Liza is a very romantic young woman. Escaping her life is extremely courageous in those times. She is deeply passionate and can only follow her heart. I love her very much!

### What do you find is unique about the audiences at Covent Garden?

The audiences in Covent Garden are just unbelievable, so generous and warm! I am so grateful for this and absolutely love singing here.

### How do you stay healthy and sane while traveling for work?

It's not always easy. When possible I travel with my dog. My beautiful dog Ruby sadly passed away this summer. We now have a new puppy. Having a dog makes you go out all the time, meet very different people and dogs give so much love and joy and put you with your feet on the ground.

### What do you know about the singing career that you wish you knew 10 years ago?

That’s a hard question! I think, just to be true to yourself and enjoy!

### If you didn't sing for a living, what do you think you would do instead?

I think I would have liked to work with animals! Maybe a dog trainer or something with horses - although I only just started riding!
