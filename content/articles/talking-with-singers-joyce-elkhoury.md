Canadian soprano [Joyce El-Khoury](/scene/people/joyce-el-khoury/) is the perfect person to ask about Violetta Valéry, the heroine of Verdi's beloved *La traviata*. She has sung the role in over twelve productions, including at De Nederlandse Opera, Welsh National Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, and currently with the Royal Opera Covent Garden. 

We met Joyce between performances in Toronto to talk about the role she knows so well, and what's good about the Canadian opera scene. For details and ticket info for the COC's *La traviata*, follow the box office links below.
