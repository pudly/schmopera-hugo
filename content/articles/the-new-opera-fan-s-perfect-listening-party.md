Readers, a quick heads up about something very cool happening Wednesday night!

On February 9 at 7:30pm ET, join [PROTOTYPE](https://prototypefestival.org/)'s listening party, featuring the soon-to-be-released album by composer David T. Little and librettist Royce Vavrek, [_Am I Born_](https://www.brightshiny.ninja/am-i-born). The work is set to come out February 11 (and you can certainly [purchase your digital copy here](https://www.brightshiny.ninja/am-i-born)), featuring The Choir of Trinity Wall Street, music director Julian Wachner and soprano Mellissa Hughes.

The event is free, but you need to [sign up by noon on February 9th](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR9tm-MPfPp1Zgw4jbgisMFa2T-fVyfgDd2DiJQJ4_GMLK-Q/viewform).

And just to make sure you all know why I'm excited about this:

* PROTOTYPE = Beth Morrison Projects, as in the folks behind [_Angel's Bone_](/angels-bone-i-finally-saw-it-and-im-never-going-to-be-the-same/), [_The Aging Magician_](/magic-everywhere-in-sdos-aging-magician/), and _p r i s m._
* The dynamic duo of David T. Little and Royce Vavrek are probably best known for their acclaimed 2012 collaboration, [_Dog Days_](https://bethmorrisonprojects.org/projects/touring/dog-days/).
* _Am I Born_ is about Brooklyn and the people who have lived there, and it just sounds downright contemporary.

PROTOTYPE's event is likely going to be a mini who's-who of the new opera scene, and this free event is a must-catch. [See you there!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR9tm-MPfPp1Zgw4jbgisMFa2T-fVyfgDd2DiJQJ4_GMLK-Q/viewform)
