I'm afraid it's too late.

I am a professional singer. I _was_ a professional singer. People used to pay me.

For twenty years, everything was fine. Then suddenly, one day, a hidden force grabbed me by the throat. And I became a singer who couldn't talk about rehearsals. I couldn't hang out with my singer friends. I couldn't talk about concerts. All of it made me want to throw up, punch someone, or cry uncontrollably. Just writing that cracks me open again.

> When I got back to my dressing room I knew I was done.

Imagine you're having a conversation and mid-sentence the corner of your mouth is pulled all the way over to your left ear. Thatâ€™s what happened to me. My left vocal cord no longer met my right one in the centre. High notes were fine. Low notes were easy. But when I tried to sing in the middle, empty pockets of air would sometimes hiss back at me, other times a note I wasn't expecting would appear. When I sang L's and R's my tongue choked me. I could no longer predict the sound coming out of my mouth.

I was newly married, renovating my home, and performing on stage _just_ enough to label myself as a "Professional Opera Singer". I knew who I was and what I wanted to do. Or at least I thought I did. I was convinced I could fix my problem. But, at my last concert whenever I sang the conductor would tilt her head abruptly in my direction. When I got back to my dressing room I knew I was done.

> My daily practice videos documented slumped shoulders, and a variety of hair cuts.

It took two years of voice specialists including one procedure where my larynx was pierced with a needle while awake. There were the three surgeries during which gel was inserted into my left vocal cord. Thankfully, I was asleep then. Finally, I invested in a formidable speech pathologist, and a kind-eyed therapist. Every second Thursday for almost four years they helped me discover what my voice was really made of.

I practiced every day. And every day I wanted to give up. I took detailed notes of what was wrong with my voice. My daily practice videos documented slumped shoulders, and a variety of hair cuts. On rare days I just stared into the camera. What was all of this for?

Then, the morning after yet _another_ birthday, I finally woke up from my nightmare.

I realized I didn't want my old voice back. I wanted a new one. I headed upstairs to my studio to delete, trash, and shred all evidence of a voice that took forty-five years to build. I locked eyes with my IKEA mirror and said, "Ok, you've got me. I surrender. Show me what's next."

> The only thing that chokes me up now is gratitude.

Days later, I cancelled my regular speech pathology appointment and went to meet a new voice teacher instead. In another two weeks, a voice I didn't recognize came soaring out of my body and filled my teacher's enormous studio. I kept track of the good things that happened. My shoulders aligned. I let my hair down. I read every book and listened to every podcast on neurology, mindset, comedy, meditation, and yoga until I had built a proper home for this new voice to move into.

It sounds simple. But it was seven years and counting. I lost friends, courage, and my mother. I questioned my identity every single day. And why expose my journey? What's so special about the evolution of a voice? Because we all have one. And it's never too late to share it.

The only thing that chokes me up now is gratitude.
