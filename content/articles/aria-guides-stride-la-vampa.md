Usually, music written in 3/8 time has a feeling of one-beat-to-the-bar, but in this aria, it's a bit murky **(1)**. There's certainly a feeling of one, but it's quite broad, almost like the beats are held back, like a dance that's a bit "off". And I think for a singer whose voice suits the role of Azucena, creating some space for all these dotted figures is wise. So, choose a tempo where you won't trip over the trills and dots, then find your big, swinging one-to-the-bar.

Part of these accents, like the one on "Urli" **(2)**, is to remind you to lighten up after the long note, so the dotted figures come out more clearly. While you lighten up, keep spinning the \[u\] vowel right through to the tied eighth note, otherwise you'll end up flat on the D on "-li". The same applies for "intorno" in the next phrase.

Really treat the "la" **(3)** as a pickup to "tetra", so your accented E's come out more dramatically. Use the crescendo/diminuendo that Verdi gives you on "fiamma", and imagine a tiny portamento from the E to the F. Work with your teacher on that double \[m\], it can be a tricky detail to include. Leading up to the trill on "ciel", plan where you're taking serious breaths, and where you're sipping. I'd advise only a sip before the second "che s'alza", so your serious breath is better for "al ciel". A note on trilling: see thy teacher.

Ideally, you've been conserving energy by coasting on this trill **(4)**, you're not giving too much too soon mid-crescendo. It's really in the last measure that you can warm back into a full sound - in fact, it's best to consider the crescendo as simply a move from light-enough-to-trill to your comfortable volume. Then, you can let rip for "che s'alza al ciel!" When you do breathe for "che", take a hair of extra time for a great-quality breath, and a bit of musical suspense.

We've skipped ahead a bit, trusting you mezzos to sing the second verse with excellent sound and great storytelling. Here **(5)**, where the text repeats, it's a spot to think about adding a few musical differences. Maybe you had an actual portamento in "fiamma", or maybe you show off with some extra volume in your high G. Doesn't have to be a full-blown cadenza - Azucena has a whole opera left to sing, after all - just some new pizzazz to avoid repetition.

Now, for some listening: I like Marilyn Horne's version of this aria, because it's just so textbook. You can hear Martin Katz all over this:
