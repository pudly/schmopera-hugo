[Music in the Barns](/scene/companies/music-in-the-barns/) is gearing up for an ambitious night at The Great Hall on **May 28**. The "imaginative multi-room transformation" includes live chamber music and interactive creative installations, all meant to address social and environmental issues that ring particularly true today.

The event is created for [CART/ACRT 2017 Conference Performing the Anthropocene: Setting the Stage for the End of the World](http://catracrt.ca/conference/catracrt-2017-performing-anthropocene/), and centres on a performance of John Cage's performance piece, *Lecture on the Weather* (1976). The piece was commissioned by the CBC, in recognition of the American bicentennial; the text, delivered by 12 performers, features an introduction by Cage himself, expressing dismay at the actions (or inaction) of the American government.

Along with *Lecture on the Weather*, the mainstage performance by the Music in the Barns chamber ensemble features works by Philip Glass and Michael Osterle, and is preceded by a talk about Cage's work, led by David Jaeger (previously of the CBC), and Music in the Barns Artistic Director Carol Gimbel.
