Baritone [John Avey](http://www.deanartists.com/vocal/baritone/john-avey) is joining the #_UncleJohn_ crew this summer, to sing the role of Michael Bridge. Who's that, you say? He's the father of Anna Bridge, the [lady you met last week](/anna/) (the one with the really [patient boyfriend](/ottavio/)). He answered my questions about returning to the Banff Centre, and why his experience at Open Space will be a special one.
