preamble: 'Another Friday night, another Opera Karaoke night at the Royal Canadian
  Legion in Banff. The singers and pianists of Open Space: Opera in the 21st Century
  ventured down the mountain for some great music and good beer. This time, we were
  heavy on the duets (think *La bohème* and *The Phantom of the Opera*), and the Legion
  patrons even got a sneak peek of [Against the Grain Theatre](/scene/companies/against-the-grain-theatre/)''s
  upcoming *A Little Too Cozy*. Of course, our favourite #operababy, Sammy, joined
  us too.'
