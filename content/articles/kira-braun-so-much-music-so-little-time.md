Toronto-based soprano [Kira Braun](/kira-braun-im-happiest-when-im-singing/) is one of those singers whose unselfish love of her craft is crystal clear. Following its official launch at Gallery 345, Braun has released *The Echoing Air*, an album of music by Purcell, Poulenc, Bellini, and Schumann with pianist Peter Krochak.

This is the fourth studio collaboration between Braun and Krochak, and their choice of repertoire seems to echo the soprano's sentiment, "I'm happiest when I'm singing."

*The Echoing Air* is available at [CDBaby](https://www.cdbaby.com/cd/kirabraunsoprano3) and [iTunes](https://itun.es/ca/SPj6ib). An alumna of the Canadian Children's Opera Company, you can hear Braun sing at their [2017/18 season launch](http://www.evite.com/event/0020BMIEK66K7U55OEPHDL6PQAKNR4/rsvp), **April 24, 6:00pm**. 

"This is such an honour to have been selected for and I continue to be deeply grateful for the time I spent with the CCOC as a kid," she says. "It stayed with me and my passion for music was built on it."

We loved chatting with Kira Braun as she released her first two albums, so pair your listening of [*The Echoing Air*](https://itun.es/ca/SPj6ib) with her [heartfelt interview](/kira-braun-im-happiest-when-im-singing/).
