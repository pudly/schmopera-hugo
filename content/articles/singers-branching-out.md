Within the last few weeks, a few of today's most admired opera singers have announced how they keep making waves in the industry, this time from off-stage. 

[Neil Shicoff has been appointed chief of opera](http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/5/News/Shicoff_Chief_of_Opera_Mikhailovsky_Theatre.html) at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. He'll assume his new role this September, intially contracted for three years. Shicoff says about his new work in St. Petersburg, "I am optimistic and hopeful that as chief of the opera of the Mikhailovsky Theater, I will be able to make further advancements in the areas of enlarging the opera repertoire, helping the soloists of the Mikhailovsky with their international careers, further present the Mikhailovsky into the international music world, develop new connections and co-productions with the leading opera houses of the world and find new young talented singers to bring to the theatre.” 

Plácido Domingo has been active offstage as well as on, currently General Director of Los Angeles Opera, and of Washinton National Opera until 2011. Next, [Domingo will take on the role of guest editor](http://www.rhinegold.co.uk/magazines/opera_now/news/opera_now_news_story.asp?id=6282) for *Opera Now*'s July/August issue. It'll feature an exclusive interview with the famed tenor, his favourite places to sing and travel, and conversations with Domingo's biggest onstage divas. [More info here](http://www.rhinegold.co.uk/magazines/opera_now/news/opera_now_news_story.asp?id=6282), and the digital issue will be available June 23rd.

Finally, Renée Fleming's contract as Creative Consultant with Lyric Opera of Chicago [has been extended for three years](http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/5/News/Ren%C3%A9e_Fleming_Lyric_Opera_of_Chicago_Consultancy.html). She'll continue her work with Lyric's mainstage and young artist programme, as well as serving on the company's board of directors. Anthony Freud, General Director of Chicago Lyric, states, "Her passion and drive, both on and off stage, bring a great spirit to the company and our art form. Renée is a wonderful partner to music director Sir Andrew Davis, to me, and to our entire organization. I look forward with eager enthusiasm to continuing our wonderful partnership with her.”

Singers, moving on up! I like it.
