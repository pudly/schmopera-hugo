	I read some 
	<a href="http://slippedisc.com/2015/03/just-in-berlin-hires-frank-gehry-86/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://slippedisc.com/2015/03/just-in-berlin-hires-frank-gehry-86/">exciting news</a> about the Berliner Staatsoper's upcoming season: Canadian architect Frank Gehry will design a production of Gluck's <em>Orpheus and Eurydice</em>, to be directed by <a href="http://www.staatsoper-berlin.de/en_EN/person/juergen-flimm.52645" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.staatsoper-berlin.de/en_EN/person/juergen-flimm.52645">Jürgen Flimm</a>, the Staatsoper's Intendant. At the podium will be Daniel Barenboim, in case the idea wasn't impressive enough. I know not everyone is a Frank Gehry fan, but I really am, and I'm thinking of planning my next overseas trip for March 2016 to catch this show.

	Gehry has designed once before for opera, when he created installations for a cool-looking production of 
	<em>Don Giovanni</em>, directed by Christopher Alden, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/disneyhall/la-et-cm-disney-hall-hawthorne-dto-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/disneyhall/la-et-cm-disney-hall-hawthorne-dto-htmlstory.html">Walt Disney Hall</a>, of course). Here's a quick look:

	Taking a look at Jürgen Flimm's aesthetic, it appears that he and Gehry will have little trouble getting on the same page with this 
	<em>Orpheus</em>. Flimm's work is quite architectural, with looming sets and eye-catching lines. He directed the <em>Salome</em> with Karita Mattila at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004, which was definitely striking. Take a look at his <em>Fidelio </em>at the Royal Opera House

<p>
	While I always hope an opera production shows off the singers and the story, at the very least, I doubt this Flimm/Gehry Gluck project will be bland.
