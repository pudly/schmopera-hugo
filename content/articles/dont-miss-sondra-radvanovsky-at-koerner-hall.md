Her performance of Queen Elizabeth I stayed with me a long time after seeing the Canadian Opera Company's 2014 production of [*Roberto Devereux*](/in-review-roberto-devereux/), so Sondra Radvanovsky's upcoming [recital at Toronto's Koerner Hall](http://performance.rcmusic.ca/event/show-one-productions-presentsbrsondra-radvanovsky-recital), presented by Show One Productions, is on my absolutely-do-not-miss list.

On December 4th, Radvanovsky joins pianist Anthony Manoli for a recital of operatic arias and art song. Radvanovsky has had a close relationship with Manoli for the last 20 years, and in an [interview with David Perlman](http://www.thewholenote.com/index.php/newsroom/musical-life/221-features/25705-sondra-radvanovsky-comes-home) in *The Whole Note*, she credits him with finding the possibilities in *bel canto* for her voice. "He heard it in my voice. I had no idea; this was a whole new world that opened up to me. I wasnâ€™t all that familiar with the bel canto repertoire, and we started with Lucrezia Borgia, actually; that was my first foray into the bel canto."

This season, Radvanovsky takes on Donizetti's "three queens" at [The Metropolitan Opera](/scene/people/metropolitan-opera/) the title roles in *Anna Bolena* and *Maria Stuarda*, and Elizabeth I in *Roberto Devereux*. Before she said yes to the monumental task, she worked with Manoli. "We took some time and looked through them and I said, 'Yes, absolutely. I want to embrace it and take the challenge'."

Frankly, I'm not picky about what Radvanovsky will sing; I just can't wait to hear that thrilling voice live again.

Tickets will no doubt go quickly, so follow our box office links below to save your seat.
