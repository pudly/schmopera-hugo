preamble: "If you're a singer, watching this video might give you the creepy-crawlies.
  It's Dame Kiri Te Kanewa singing \"Dove sono i bei momenti\" from *Le nozze di Figaro*
  at the [Metropolitan Opera's Centennial Gala](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1062163/),
  1983. Kiri sings this staple aria of hers as beautifully as you would expect. \n\nNear
  the end, a terrifying thing happens: *a memory slip*. It's super subtle, tricky
  to catch right away (that probably means it's an easy trap for sopranos).\n\nThis
  one is all about the recovery though; smooth like butter, even at the Met with thousands
  of (real) opera folks watching. Have a watch, and skip to 5:00 if you're impatient.
  Oh, and stay tuned for her beautiful exchange with Maestro Levine as the applause
  roars in."
