Soprano and opera comedienne [Kyra Millan](/kyra-millan-arts-education-counts/) returns to the Royal Conservatory of Music for their [*Opera Overtures*](https://ca.apm.activecommunities.com/theroyalconservatory/Activity_Search/2079) course, each Monday night from 7-8:30pm, **March 21 to April 18**. Over five weeks, partipants will "learn about the history, the music, and the sublime and sublimely ridiculous elements that make opera so fabulous."

Each session will focus on a different element of opera, with vocal and physical warm-ups, theatre games, video presentation, and interactive chats. Participants will be in great hands with instructor Kyra Millan, who values the accessibility of opera, without dumbing it down. Plus, the course fee ($185) includes tickets to the dress rehearsals of *Lucio Silla* at Opera Atelier on April 15th and *Carmen* at the Canadian Opera Company on April 9th.

Participants already enrolled in select Royal Conservatory classes automatically get 10% off the *Opera Overtures* course fee, and and students of this course can get 15% off tickets for the Glenn Gould School Opera's *Alcina*, conducted by Ivars Taurins, **March [16th](https://performance.rcmusic.ca/event/1516/spring_opera_1) and [18th](https://performance.rcmusic.ca/event/1516/spring_opera_2)**.
