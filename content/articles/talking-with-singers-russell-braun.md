Star baritone [Russell Braun](/scene/people/russell-braun/) is one of Canada's favoured artists, and next month, he'll sing one of his signature roles at what he calls his home company. He has been singing Count Almaviva in Mozart's *Le nozze di Figaro* for twenty years, and he joins bass-baritone Josef Wagner and Canadian sopranos [Jane Archibald](/scene/people/jane-archibald/) and [Erin Wall](/scene/people/erin-wall/) in Claus Guth's production, at the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/comapnies/canadian-opera-company/) from February 4 to 27.

Russell made time between rehearsals to chat with us about singing a layered character like the Count, and why a career as a musician is worth the challenges.
