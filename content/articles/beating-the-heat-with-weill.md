  If you're currently in Toronto, you know the heat is pretty awful indeed. So, the train of thought went thus: *ugh, it's hot..."Ain't it awful, the heat?"...Man, Street Scene is so great. Why don't people do it more?...Ice Cream Sextet!*

  Here's a clip from A Salute to American Music: A Richard Tucker Foundation Gala, 1992. Jerry Hadley is the Italiam immigrant ice-cream lover, Lippo Fiorentino, singing the Ice Cream Sextet from Kurt Weill's *Street Scene*. Hadley sings with  Maureen O'Flynn, Phyllis Pancella, Paul Groves, Daniel Smith & Jeff Mattsey.

  Stay cool, readers!
