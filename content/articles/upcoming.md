## _Pandora_

The latest from Toronto-based **FAWN Chamber Creative**, the new opera-ballet sees its [world premiere run](https://fawnchambercreative.ticketleap.com/pandora/) from May 23-25 at Geary Lane (260 Geary Ave.). _Pandora_ is the product of librettist David James Brock, and composers Joseph Glaser, Kit Soden, and David Storen.

“Although this piece isn't directly about the myth," says stage director Amanda Smith, "I imagine that in _Pandora_ we see what happens when the jar, or box, is opened a second time."

## _Lucretia_

May 23-25, New York-based **Cantata Profana** presents a concert anchored around Handel's "genre busting" oratorio, [_Lucretia_](https://here.org/shows/lucretia/). "Handel was one of the greatest dramatists to ever compose for the voice. This piece is proof," says Jacob Ashworth, Artistic Director of Cantata Profana.

Sharing the programme are works spanning ten centuries, including music from the poet-composers that gave us the original _Carmina Burana_.

[_La Lucretia_](https://here.org/shows/lucretia/) runs for three performances at HERE, 145 6th Ave.

## _Chunky in Heat_

A team effort by the aptly named **Experiments in Opera** and chamber orchestra **Contemporaneous**, [_Chunky in Heat_](http://experimentsinopera.com/portfolio-item/chunky-in-heat/) gets its premiere run at New York's The Flea (20 Thomas St), May 31-June 2.

_Chunky in Heat_ marks the first libretto by author A.M. Homes, set to music by six composers: Jason Cady, Paula Matthusen, Erin Rogers, Aaron Siegel, Shelley Washington, and Matthew Welch. It's a 14-scene coming-of-age story set in Los Angeles, which follows a single family over three decades.

"Together with six composers and director Alison Moritz we have put together a rare breed among new operas—a work that is funny, dark, hallucinatory, and full of portent for our troubled times."

[_Chunky in Heat_](http://experimentsinopera.com/portfolio-item/chunky-in-heat/) runs for three performances, May 31-June 2.

## New York Festival of Song

Acknowledging Pride month and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, **New York Festival of Song** presents two notable events.

On June 11, [_Laura Kaminsky & Friends on Stonewall_](http://5bmf.org/nyfos-next-manning-the-canon/) offers a programme of music by women and lesbian artists, curated by composer Laura Kaminsky (_As One_). Happening June 22 and 25 is [_Manning the Canon: Songs of Gay Life_](http://5bmf.org/nyfos-next-manning-the-canon/), an evening of songs (and drag acts) compiled by NYFOS Artistic Director Steven Blier, each by and about gay men.

Both concerts are co-presented by NYFOS and Five Boroughs Music Festival. Click for [details and tickets](http://5bmf.org/nyfos-next-manning-the-canon/).

## _Music of Kline, Spears, and Eastman_

On June 8 at New York's Roulette, **The String Orchestra of Brooklyn** presents [_Music of Kline, Spears, and Eastman_](https://roulette.org/event/the-string-orchestra-of-brooklyn-music-of-kline-spears-and-eastman/), a night of newly commissioned music. On the programme is a new arrangement of Julius Eastman's _Gay Guerrilla_, and the world premieres of Gregory Spears' _Concerto for Two Trumpets and Strings_, and Phil Kline's _Four Songs from Florida Man_.

"Florida Man embraces a kind of American craziness that seems to do especially well in the sun," says Kline of his new piece.

The concert is one-night-only, [June 8, Roulette](https://roulette.org/event/the-string-orchestra-of-brooklyn-music-of-kline-spears-and-eastman/) (509 Atlantic Ave.).
