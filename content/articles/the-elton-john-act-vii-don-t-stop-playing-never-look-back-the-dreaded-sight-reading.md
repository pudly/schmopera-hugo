For British people like me, the phrase "sight-reading" more often than not evokes panicked memories of entering dusty church halls as a child in order to strut your stuff in a graded music exam. It was only when I started working with musicians outside the UK that I realised what a fantastic education this was, as many other countries do not insist on sight reading from a young age. For the hopeful répétiteur, sight-reading is one of the key pillars that we must rely on in our musical lives. While ideally we should never be asked to sight read in the context of an opera production, when accompanying for auditions we often receive the music only half an hour before, and will get around fifteen minutes or so to put it together with the singer. No early-career répétiteur can be expected to know all of the "standard" opera repertoire, so we must be able to read quickly, and present a confident accompaniment that supports the singer.

The good news is that sight-reading can be worked upon and improved, though sadly too many people get bogged down in thorny nests of notes, and are unable to clear them away in order to find the music that lies beyond. In an audition, this is the key; the panel don't expect you to get every note right, and will be forgiving if a fair few go by the wayside, as long as the general harmony is clear. What is more difficult to forgive is a lack of musicality in the sight-reading. If your right-hand articulation in a Handel aria is unable to conjure up the frenzied bow movements of an entire first violin section, or your playing in a Strauss aria is devoid of all the rich bass that purrs throughout the orchestra, then it is unlikely you will make a good impression. 

The basics of sight-reading are no different from the advice I was given before entering the church halls all those years ago: check the key signature, check the tempo (you can always ask for this if it is unclear), and get a rough idea of the whole excerpt before you begin to play, including any changes of time or difficult harmonic passages. A technique I learnt only recently was to actively make my eyes focus on the upcoming bars, so that by scanning ahead, I always have a heads up of any pitfalls or nasty surprises on the horizon. It’s not always easy to do this consistently, but if you can practise it regularly it will become easier. You shouldn't usually have to sing along when sight-reading for an audition.
