short_description: François Racine is the revival director of Robert Lepage&#039;s
  production of Bluebeard&#039;s Castle/Erwartung, and he has seen the double bill
  performed across the globe over the last 20 years. He took a few moments out of
  a tech rehearsal in the Four Seasons Centre to talk about these two &quot;very dark&quot;
  operas, and this production by Lepage that seems so timelessly compelling.

François Racine is the revival director of [Robert Lepage's production of *Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BluebeardErwartung.aspx), and he has seen the double bill performed across the globe over the last 20 years. He took a few moments out of a tech rehearsal in the Four Seasons Centre to talk about these two "very dark" operas, and this production by Lepage that seems so timelessly compelling.

*Bluebeard's Castle* stars bass [John Relyea](http://www.johnrelyea.com/) in the title role, and soprano [Ekaterina Gubanova](https://twitter.com/gubanovamezzo) as his wife, Judith. *Erwartung* features mezzo [Krisztina Szabó](/talking-with-singers-krisztina-szabo/) as The Woman. COC Music Director Johannes Debus conducts Lepage's double-bill, and you absolutely don't want to miss it. Follow the links below for tickets and details.
