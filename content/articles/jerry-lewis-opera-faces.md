Readers, we can't stop watching this clip of Jerry Lewis lip-syncing to Mario Lanza's "Be My Love." 

Singer-face, anyone? Just kidding.

Bonus: "Be My Love" was written for Lanza to sing with Kathryn Grayson in the 1950 film *The Toast of New Orleans*. [Watch the clip right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coZkDIL8DzM). We forgot how gorgeous Mario is.
