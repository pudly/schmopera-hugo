This week, go see something a little different. Originally created by [Coleman Lemieux & Compagnie](http://colemanlemieux.com/) in 2005, *Les paradis perdus / Remix* is a melding of music and dance that's "a world within a world." The show is part of the new [BRIGHT NIGHTS](http://colemanlemieux.com/citadel/brightnights/) dance/theatre series, and *Les paradis perdus* features original music by Victoria-based composer Christopher Butterfield. Choreographer [Laurence Lemieux](http://colemanlemieux.com/company/laurencelemieux/) leads dancers Luke Garwood and Erin Poole in this work that is "inspired by childhood memories both fond and fearsome."

Butterfield's music is intimately connected with movement, and with the choreographer herself. He spoke a bit about how he does that: "The active idea was to create a sound poetry out of Ms. Lemieux’s memories by rigorously removing syllables in sequence from the French text, and then speaking/singing the result. Gradually the missing syllables are replaced (although not completely), so that an appearance of sense gradually shows itself – but never completely."

Performances are October 14-17, 8pm at The Citadel, 304 Parliament St (Parliament and Dundas East). For details, tickets, and more info about Coleman Lemieux & Compagnie's BRIGHT NIGHTS series, follow the box office links below.
