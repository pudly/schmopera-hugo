Something depressing occurred to me over the weekend. It happened while I was reading star soprano Angel Blue's [now-viral announcement on social media](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/16/us-soprano-angel-blue-slams-blackface-pulls-out-of-italy-opera) that she would be pulling out of Arena di Verona's upcoming production of _La traviata_, because of how the company handled (or didn't handle at all) Anna Netrebko's latest foray into actual blackface.

"Let me be perfectly clear: the use of blackface under any circumstances, artistic or otherwise, is a deeply misguided practice based on archaic theatrical traditions which have no place in modern society," Blue wrote. "It is offensive, humiliating and outright racist."

(Note: As of my writing this, Angel Blue's accounts on Instagram and Facebook aren't currently available, which makes sense considering the flurry of media coverage her statement rightfully earned. I hope she's doing OK and not simply drowning in hateful DMs...)

The Arena di Verona put out a [statement in response](https://operawire.com/arena-di-verona-releases-statement-regarding-angel-blues-cancelation/) to Blue's cancellation:

"The 2022 première of ‘Aida’ took place on 18th June. This production’s characteristics were well known when Angel Blue knowingly committed herself to sing at the Arena. Every country has different roots, and their cultural and social structures developed along different historical and cultural paths. Sensibilities and approaches on the same subject might widely vary in different parts of the world."

I mean, it's definitely a non-answer that suggests that blackface has been a part of at least an Italian opera culture for a while, and one can't expect it to go away just like that. I mean, it's just a matter of the Arena _not breaking out the darkened makeup_, or at the very least, [a singer refusing to wear it](https://www.veronasera.it/attualita/tamara-wilson-polemica-razzismo-aida-verona-arena-blackface-26-luglio-2019.html), but who am I to butt in?
