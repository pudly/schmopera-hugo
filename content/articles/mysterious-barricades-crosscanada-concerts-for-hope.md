On **September 10, World Suicide Prevention Day**, 13 Canadian cities will host free, live-streamed concerts presented by the Mysterious Barricades Concert Society, [*A Cross-Canada Concert for Suicide Awareness, Prevention and Hope*.](http://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/)

Led by President and mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Turnbull, Mysterious Barricades is named after a [favourite piece of music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI5CXRrvdUM) of her late husband, Chris', who sadly took his own life last year. The organization has organized an incredible [18-hour series of concerts](http://www.mysteriousbarricades.org/concerts/) happening across Canada, starting at sunrise in St. John's, NL, and ending at sunset in Victoria, BC.

Their mission:

"To bring the gift of music to Canada on World Suicide Prevention Day, to raise awareness surrounding the mysterious barricades between mental illness and health, between the darkness of depression and a flicker of hope, between life and death. To encourage public discourse about the prevalence of suicide and measures for suicide prevention. To encourage the formation of community by those impacted by suicide, and to raise funds for education and support for those at risk and those impacted by suicide."

Helping achieve their mission are some of Canada's top artists, including Marcia Swanston (Halifax, NS), the Tesla Quartet (Sackville, NB) Russell Braun (Toronto, ON), Kimberly Barber (Kitchener-Waterloo, ON), Jackalyn Short (London, ON), John Avey (Ottawa, ON), Tracey Dahl (Winnipeg, MB), Kathy Gable (Saskatoon, SK), Patrick Raftery (Vancouver, BC), Elizabeth Turnbull (Edmonton, AB) and Benjamin Butterfield (Victoria).
