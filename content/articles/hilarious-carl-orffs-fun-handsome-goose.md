Misheard lyrics, anyone? In the name of fail-safe laughter, we wanted to share with you an oldie but a goodie, and what's perhaps the funniest versions of Orff's *Carmina Burana* available today.

And yes, we should absolutely get that octopus some boots, and send him to North Korea.

For more fun in the same vein, be sure to check out Rainer Hersch's [cheeky "translation" of Mozart's "Come scoglio"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjeQtbKFlHc).
