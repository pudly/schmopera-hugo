Whenever I hunt for opera on YouTube, I find a [gem or two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LXUrnVdV7M). But this time, I struck gold. 

*Don Giovanni Unmasked* is a film version of Mozart's masterpiece, produced by the CBC and directed Barbara Willis Sweete, of [The Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD Broadcasts](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2012/11/03/torontos-barbara-willis-sweete-the-master-of-1100-camera-angles-for-metropolitan-opera-otello-in-hd/).

There are so many amazing things about this. 

1. First of all, Dmitri Hvorostovsky stars as the Don...*and* Leporello. Love it. But wait, it gets better!

2. The music was conducted by Richard Bradshaw, leading the COC Orchestra.

3. The cast is full of Canadians: Alain Coulombe (Masetto), Krisztina Szabó (Zerlina),  Michael Colvin (Ottavio), Dominique Labelle (Donna Anna), Barbara Dunn-Prosser (Donna Elvira), and Gary Relyea (the Commendatore).

*Don Giovanni Unmasked* left me pretty confused on a lot of fronts, but it's oddly riveting. The concept is bizarre, with Leporello as the emcee of a film screening; in said film (black & white, of course) is where we see Don Giovanni, dressed in a way that makes me think of Zorro. So, that means that sometimes Dmitri Hvorostovsky is talking to himself through a movie screen. Plus, there's a pretty crazy plot twist at the end.

Enjoy!
