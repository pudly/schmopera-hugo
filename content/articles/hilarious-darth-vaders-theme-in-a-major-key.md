short_description: When we were still in university, my classmates and I would nerd
  out on playing things like &quot;Deh vieni, non tardar&quot; in F minor, or &quot;Mein
  Herr, Marquis&quot; in G minor, and it was hilarious to us for reasons I can&#039;t
  quite articulate. This reminds me of those times.

We stumbled across something great, and we had to share it with our readers. UK-based musician, writer, and amateur film-maker [Ian Gordon](http://iangordon.bandcamp.com/) has re-written John Williams' infamous *Imperial March* from *Star Wars*, in a major key.

When we were still in university, my classmates and I would nerd out on playing things like "Deh vieni, non tardar" in F minor, or "Mein Herr, Marquis" in G minor, and it was hilarious to us for reasons I can't quite articulate.

This reminds me of those times. From [Ian Gordon's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mutedvocal), there's [*Staying Dead (The Walking Dead in a Major Key)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmCBzwzw2Cc), which is very John Adams, and [*The X-Files Theme in a Major Key*](https://youtu.be/qTRXOnbuJVM), which reminds me of Enya.
