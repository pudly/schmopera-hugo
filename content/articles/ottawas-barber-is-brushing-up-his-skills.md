Ottawans, do you love opera? Do you love a good haircut? Head over to Byward Market Square tomorrow to find out more about both.

[Opera Lyra Ottawa](/scene/companies/opera-lyra-ottawa/)'s production of [*The Barber of Seville*](https://operalyra.ca/current-season-productions/the-marriage-of-figaro/) opens September 26th, and not only will baritone [Joshua Hopkins](/scene/people/joshua-hopkins/) sing the title role (Torontonians caught him in the COC's *Barber* last spring), he'll be getting a lesson in the tonsorial arts (#wordoftheday!) from [House of Barons Barber Shop](http://www.houseofbarons.ca/).

Hopkins will practice on folks like Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, Hugo Lopez of the Ottawa Redbacks, and "Butterfly Boy" [Jonathan Pitre](http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/10/meet-the-incredibly-brave-butterfly-boy-who-refuses-to-give-up-hope-despite-constant-pain-5336086/). Of course, because he's Figaro, Hopkins will be singing while he works.

The barbers trade tips tomorrow at 12:15pm, 60 Byward Market Square. Ottawa readers, I implore you to send me video footage.

Also, go see Opera Lyra's *Barber*! It's got a stellar cast of Canadians, including [Marion Newman](/scene/people/marion-newman/) (Rosina), [Peter McGillivray](/scene/people/peter-mcgillivray/) (Bartolo), [Giles Tomkins](/scene/people/giles-tomkins/) (Basilio), and Schmopera contributor [Isaiah Bell](http://www.schmopera.com/on-the-ego/) (Count Almaviva).
