Next month, Opera Orlando presents *One Voice Orlando: A Celebration in Song*, a benefit concert on the three-month anniversary of the mass shooting in Orlando's Pulse nightclub. 

Hosted by famed baritone Sherrill Milnes, and conducted by David Charles Abell, the concert will donate proceeds to Orlando Health's Level One Trauma Center, the Orlando LGBTQ Community Center, Proyecto Somos Orlando, the Interfaith Council of Central Florida, the Zebra Coalition, and the Holocaust Center's "UpStanders: Stand Up to Bullying Initiative."

"One of the main reasons we are presenting this concert is to give back to the community and recognize the men and women that responded so valiantly during this tragedy," says Gabriel Preisser, Executive and Artistic Director of Opera Orlando. "The Orlando Health's Level One Trauma Center saved many lives through their quick and effective response but their resources were severely depleted. The dollars we donate from One Voice Orlando will make a big difference. We'll also be honoring the doctors and staff of the Trauma Center during the concert."

Happening one night only on **September 11, 8pm, at Walt Disney Theater**, artists for *One Voice Orlando* include sopranos Cecilia Violetta Lopez, Sarah Joy Miller, Ana Maria Martinez, mezzo Jennifer Johnson Cano, tenors Javier Abreu and Chad Johnson, and baritones Mark Walters and Davis Gaines, all of whom will donate their time.

OPERA America has also stepped up to lend a hand in gathering Florida-wide opera companies for this concert, including a 150-voice choir, and contributions from Opera Naples, St. Petersburg Opera, Opera Tampa, Gulfshore Opera, First Coast Opera and Sarasota Opera.

"When we learned of Opera Orlando's effort to serve the community at this important time, we were honored to help make this a demonstration of field-wide unity behind our brothers and sisters in Orlando," said Marc. A. Scorca, president/CEO of OPERA America. "Everyone responded enthusiastically, demonstrating our field's commitment to strengthening bonds of understanding through opera."
