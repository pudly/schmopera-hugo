The 2016/17 season of [Rosenblatt Recitals](/ian-rosenblatt-its-all-about-the-voice/) continued last night with baritone [Simone Piazzola](/scene/people/simone-piazzola/) and pianist [Giuseppe Vaccaro](/scene/people/giuseppe-vaccaro/) at Wigmore Hall. 

The pair paid homage to their Italian roots with a programme of Donizetti, Verdi, Mozart, and songs by Paolo Tosti. In fact, the Tosti songs that Piazzola and Vaccaro chose were first performed in London - and did you know: Tosti taught at the Royal Academy of Music, became a British citizen in 1906, and was knighted by King Edward VII in 1908?

Piazzola sang with an easy darkness in his sound, and Vaccaro was a beautiful collaborator; the pair found flexibility fueled by the language, and Piazzola's shy smiles to the audience were heartfelt. He seemed to risk quite a lot in his soft singing, a bit of a shame considering the thrill in his full voice.

Vaccaro took on a truly collaborative role with Piazzola, and he also had two opportunities to take the spotlight as a solo pianist. He brought a bright, Italianate sound to Liszt's *Rigoletto: paraphrase de concert S434* and *Hungarian Rhapsody in C sharp minor*; Vaccaro's playing was full of joy, and it confirmed our suspicions that Liszt is entirely insufferable. (His piano works remind us of that quote by Coco Chanel: "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.")

Piazzola packed his second half with arias from *La favorita*, *Lucia di Lammermoor*, *Il trovatore*, and Gounod's *Faust*. He sang with audibly more confidence in the world of opera, with the dramatic refinement of many hours in rehearsal in roles like Enrico and the Conte di Luna; his sound stayed rich and masculine, and his top was totally thrilling. Along with the subtle beauty in his "Deh vieni alla finestra" from *Don Giovanni*, it was Verdi's "Il balen del suo sorriso" from *Il trovatore* that showed off his most mature singing of the evening. 

Thought Piazzola seemed somewhat shy onstage, he and Vaccaro gave a polished, flashy programme. His earnest singing resulted in two Verdi encores: Rodrigo's "Son io, mio Carlo" from *Don Carlo*, and Germont's "Di Provenza il mar" from *La traviata*.

Piazzola heads next to Florence, where he sings Marcello in *La boh√®me* at Opera di Firenze, before reprising Rodrigo in *Don Carlo* at Teatro alla Scala. For more, follow Piazzola on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SimonePiazzolaBaritono/) and [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/SimonePiazzola)
