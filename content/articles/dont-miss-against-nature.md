Next month sees the world premiere of [*Against Nature (À Rebours)*](http://colemanlemieux.com/portfolio/againstnature/), presented by Coleman Lemieux & Compagnie. It's the second in a series of salon pieces by [James Kudelka](http://colemanlemieux.com/company/james_kudelka/), director and choreographer, following up on [*From the House of Mirth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TXW20BvDEc&feature=youtu.be) in 2012 and 2013. *Against Nature* features music by Canadian composer [James Rolfe](/scene/people/james-rolfe/) (*Beatrice Chancy*, *Elijah's Kite*, [*Crush*](/james-rolfe-anna-chatterton-on-creating-crush/)) and a libretto by award-winning playwright [Alex Poch-Goldin](https://www.playwrightsguild.ca/playwright/alex-poch-goldin) (*Cringeworthy*, *From the House of Mirth*, *The Shadow*). 

The work is based on the book of the same name by Joris-Karl Huysmans, about a wealthy, contrarian aesthete who has grown to despise human society. He leaves Paris and retreats to the countryside to contemplate life, rather than be a part of it.
