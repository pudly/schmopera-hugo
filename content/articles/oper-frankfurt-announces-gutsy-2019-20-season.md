## New productions

**_Pénèlope_ (G. Fauré) - Dec. 1, 2019-Jan. 23, 2020**

Fauré is an idiosyncratic, anti-dramatic composer whose work depends on subtlety. How will his music fare on the opera stage, which can reward boldness over taste? If there's a single moment that matches the blissful sequencing melodies of his [C minor piano quintet](https://open.spotify.com/track/0IhLPNXylgvhKl52xPYFWw?si=952MdnZnQMuYuM6JzWpOdw), the exuberant, shifting harmonies of [_La bonne chanson_](https://open.spotify.com/track/6WGI7vfAff6nQfDplJmShI?si=ebntffUiQriH_Ys-iyd75g), or the austere, mercurial shapeshifting of his [late songs](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Y6wIlK5h53WviiQOH3U1i?si=mK4SA5BTSxC2aQAeesbRrQ), it'll be a worthwhile evening at the opera.

**_Tamerlano_ (G.F. Händel) - Nov. 7-24, 2019**

[R.B. Schlather](/feminist-truths-the-mother-of-us-all/) directs a new production of _Tamerlano_ featuring the fastidious countertenor Lawrence Zazzo in the title role. Händel opera is director fodder and Schlather's open-hearted approach should undergird the work's enormous stakes with full-fleshed humanity.

**_Otello_, _La gazzetta_, and _Bianca e falliero_ (G. Rossini)**

Three new productions of unknown Rossini operas in one season? Oh boy. Maybe it's a shot at redemption for last season's _I puritani_ directed by Vincent Boussard, which, despite a loaded cast, was interminable. Now Boussard is out of the picture and Rossini has replaced Bellini. Add to the mix soprano Elizabeth Sutphen and other excellent Frankfurt regulars and it's a trilogy to look forward to.

**_Manon Lescaut_ (G. Puccini) - Oct. 6-Nov. 23, 2019**

After a taste of the gutsy soprano Asmik Grigorian ([International Opera Award](http://www.operaawards.org/archive/2019/)'s Best Female Singer 2019) in Tchaikovsky's one-act [_Iolanta_](/the-follies-of-modernization-oedipus-rex-iolanta/) last season, I (and the rest of the Oper Frankfurt audience) hoped she'd be back in a role that allowed her to stretch out and wail away. Lucky for us, she's taking on the epic lead in _Manon Lescaut_, one of the most punishing (and thrilling) soprano roles in the repertoire.

**_Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District_ (D. Shostakovich) - Nov. 3-Dec. 12, 2019**

As far as I'm concerned, the more Shostakovich the better. The composer belongs to a group of masters – including Scriabin and Chopin – whose work reaches vocal music devotee's ears far less than it should. _Lady Macbeth_'s explosive score teems with a pathos that lives up to its fascinating offstage history of censorship under Stalin.

**_Salome_ (R. Strauss) - Mar. 1-Apr. 13, 2020**

Baritone Christopher Maltman has had an ideal career trajectory. After years as a leading interpreter of Mozart, art song and other repertoire generous to the developing voice, Maltman has transitioned to heavy duty rep like Jochanaan and Rigoletto (also in repertory this season).

Barrie Kosky, whose beloved _Carmen_ is back after selling out its entire 2018-19 run, brings a new _Salome_ to Frankfurt, starring Ambur Braid and Maltman. It's surely the most anticipated production of the season.

## Recitals

The 2019-20 series is replete with big names in opera including current MET stars Pretty Yende and Peter Mattei, and Frankfurt favorites [Jakub Józef Orliński](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/the-dizzying-democratization-of-baroque-music) and John Osborn. However the recital I'm most looking forward to is Florian Boesch's (Feb. 25, 2020). The rich-voiced baritone is in league with Matthias Goerne and Dietrich Henschel as one of the great Lieder interpreters of the modern era.

## Revivals

**_Carmen_ (G. Bizet) - Jan. 31-Mar. 7, 2020**

It's premature to call it timeless, but Barrie Kosky's _Carmen_ is aging well. It was the most popular revival of 2018-19 and should sell out again this coming season. Particularly exciting is the addition of Gordon Bintner as the toreador Escamillo. The baritone has a deliberate elegance to his movement and effortless blooming high notes. In other words, he's made for the role.

**_Don Giovanni_ (W.A. Mozart) - Apr. 24-Jun. 26, 2020**

This stark psychological production debuted with a baritone possessing similar qualities in the title role, the cerebral Christian Gerhaher. Now, Bintner takes the lead (for half of the run) joined by Božidar Smiljanić (Leporello), who demonstrated his startlingly facile instrument in smaller roles last season.

**_Three Short Operas_ (Křenek) - Oct. 11-Nov. 1, 2019**

Ernst Křenek was an enormously influential composer Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weil, Marc Blitzstein and others of that era. The integration of modern colloquial idioms, instruments, and ideas into his work led to a grittier realism than verismo ever accomplished. Despite that, you could find a hundred _Street Scenes_ for every _Johnny spielt auf_ and, at least in North America, he remains largely unperformed.

**_The Cunning Little Vixen_ (L. Janáček) - May 1-23, 2020**

The beloved score bursts with folkloric verve and heady, gut-tumbling lyricism. Two Americans lead the cast: The exuberant soprano Elizabeth Reiter stars in the title role and mezzo-soprano Kelsey Lauritano as her counterpart.
