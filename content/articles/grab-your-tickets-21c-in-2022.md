A few Canada-based items for you, readers.

In the short-term: get signed up for the Canadian Opera Company's [digital membership](https://www.coc.ca/Free-Digital-Membership-Page)! It gets you access to the COC's season - which so far, has unveiled a solid [line-up of digital events](https://www.coc.ca/2122), all free to stream.

The first item happens **September 25, 7:30pm ET**: Canadian favourite [Russell Braun](/scene/people/russell-braun/) and acclaimed American soprano [Tamara Wilson](/scene/people/tamara-wilson/) pair up with the COC Orchestra, for a [concert](https://www.coc.ca/productions/22877) streamed right from the much-missed Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. So far, we're promised operatic highlights by Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, and Bizet; and honestly, even if that changes, I'm still tuning in with bells on.

And stick around for the rest of the COC's digital fall: they're offering [_Gianni Schicchi_](https://www.coc.ca/productions/22879) starting **October 30** starring [Roland Wood](/scene/people/roland-wood/), and [Mozart's _Requiem_](https://www.coc.ca/productions/22881) in collaboration with [Against the Grain Theatre](https://atgtheatre.com/upcoming/requiem/) starting **November 26**.

And if you're done with digital, never fear: tickets are now on sale for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's _TSO at the Drive-In_ series. On **September 24 and 25 at 7:30pm ET**, catch a [mostly-Mozart programme](https://www.tso.ca/concert/mozart-martines) (including his famed _Eine kleine Nachtmusik_, which is ironically a rarity on the concert stage, I've found) that also features an overture by Viennese Mozart contemporary Marianna Martines. And on **October 1 and 2, 7:30pm ET**, join maestro Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser for [_Pride Together_](https://www.tso.ca/concert/pride-together), "a high-octane program that parallels the journey of the 2SLGBTQ+ community". We're promised "Vogue" and "Time Warp", so it's a done deal. The two concerts are set to go up at Toronto's [CityView Drive-In](https://cityviewdrivein.com/), and space is limited, so snag your spot quick.

And in the long-term: I know it's a bit early to think about January 2022, but in this case, we must.

Tickets for the Royal Conservatory of Music's annual contemporary music festival, [21C](https://www.rcmusic.com/performance/21c-music-festival?_ga=2.20016318.706228005.1630957371-1404247250.1630957371), go on sale to the general public on **September 10, 2021** - that's today! And now that in-person concert tickets are more coveted than ever, it's important to note that this season's 21C line-up, running January-February 2022, is not to be missed.

It's certainly cool that the [Kronos Quartet](https://www.schmopera.com/constantly-new-the-kronos-quartet/) is doing a residency for this year's festival; they're slated for three performances, including a concert with [Glenn Gould School students](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/kronos-quartet-with-students-from-the-glenn-go-(2)), and a [live documentary](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/kronos-quartet-on-film-a-thousand-thoughts-(2)) presented in partnership with the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema.

It's definitely cool about watching mezzo [Blythe Gaissert](/scene/people/blythe-gaissert/) and bass-baritone [Kelly Markgraf](/scene/people/kelly-markgraf/) in the Canadian premiere of Marc Neikrug's [_A Song by Mahler_](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/arc-ensemble-marc-neikrug-s-a-song-by-mahler-(2)), the one-act opera opera about singer, famous for singing Mahler's _Liebst du um Schönheit_, and her battle with Alzheimer's.

And yes, there are rich recital offerings, out of [Gerald Finley and Julius Drake](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/gerald-finley-and-julius-drake), [Morgan-Paige Melbourne](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/morgan-paige-melbourne-(2)), [Eve Egoyan](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/21c-cinq-a-sept-eve-egoyan-(3)), the [Danish String Quartet](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/danish-string-quartet), and [Angèle Dubeau](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/angele-dubeau-la-pieta-(3)).

But if you ask me and my opera-bias, the big draw for this season's 21C is the world premiere of [_Gould's Wall_](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/goulds-wall), the new opera by Brian Current and [Liza Balkan](https://www.schmopera.com/meet-the-director-liza-balkan/), produced by new-opera leaders, [Tapestry Opera](/scene/companies/tapestr-opera/). Inspired by Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, the "adventurous singers" of _Gould's Wall_ are set to sing suspended in the air. Shows run **January 12-16, 2022**. (And if you just can't wait until September 10th to snag your ticket, become a Tapestry Opera Premium Member [here](https://tapestryopera.com/membership/).)
