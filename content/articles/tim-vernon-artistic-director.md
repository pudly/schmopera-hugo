If you've not yet heard the news, Maestro Timothy Vernon has been appointed the new Artistic Director of [Opera Lyra Ottawa](/scene/people/opera-lyra-ottawa/). Vernon will begin immediately with the 2015/16 season, and he'll maintain his position as Artistic Director of [Pacific Opera Victoria](/scene/companies/pacific-opera-victoria/). A busy man just got busier. 

Maestro Vernon stated, 

> "I believe Opera Lyra to be a natural home and showcase for talented Canadians in every aspect of opera production. I look forward eagerly to working to expand the circle of opera-lovers who believe strongly in the vital role our arts have to play in fostering a vibrant, creative, forward-looking and finally humane society, and who want to ensure that Opera Lyra remains a key player in our cultural life."

Opera Lyra's production of *Fidelio* in March, 2016, will be maestro Vernon's first task at the podium, and the [season](https://operalyra.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-16_OL_Brochure.pdf) begins in September with *The Barber of Seville*. 

Vernon added a quick video statement about his new  digs:
