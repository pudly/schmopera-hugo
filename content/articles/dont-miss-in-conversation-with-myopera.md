This coming **Thursday, March 3rd** you can catch me at [The Spoke Club](http://www.thespokeclub.com/), chatting with some of the most inspiring upstarts in Canadian opera.

I'll be moderating an event called "In Conversation with MYOpera", at The Spoke Club here in downtown Toronto.

I'm really excited to be chatting with [MYOpera](/scene/companies/myopera/)'s Artistic Director [Kate Applin](/scene/people/kate-applin/), Music Director [Natasha Fransblow](https://www.myopera.ca/our-team/), Stage Director [Anna Theodosakis](https://www.myopera.ca/our-team/) and tenor [Daevyd Pepper](/scene/people/daevyd-pepper/), all of whom are involved with their exciting upcoming production of Britten's [*The Rape of Lucretia*](https://www.myopera.ca/lucretia2016/).

Join us at 7:00pm as we talk frankly and openly about all the work, from various aspects, that's necessary in today's world to produce opera independently. Trust me, you won't find more knowledgeable people in one room at the same time unless you crash a rehearsal.

So, why not stop by and bring a friend, grab a drink and join the discussion? Admission is free, and it totally appears to be shaping up as a great night of conversation, information and inspiration.

Space is extremely limited and likely to fill up quickly, so please RSVP to [info@myopera.ca](mailto:info@myopera.ca). If you can't make it in person, fear not; it will be streamed on [Periscope](https://www.periscope.tv/) under the MYOpera handle.

Did I mention I'm moderating? Chances are there will be a laugh or two. (Editor's note: or three.)
