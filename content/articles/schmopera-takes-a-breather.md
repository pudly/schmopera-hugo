title: "Schmopera takes a breather"
---

A quick heads-up, readers: for the month of August, Schmopera will be changing pace. We'll go from our usual peppy *allegro* to more of an *larghetto*, as we take, #waitforit, a vacation!

You'll still hear from us, because there are artists to meet and companies to check out; seasonal as the opera season may be, it never really stops. As always, readers are welcome to send their ideas for interviews, editorials, new items, etc., to [contribute@schmopera.com](mailto:contribute@schmopera/com).

To make sure you stay in the loop, be sure to sign up for our newsletter, using the big orange link at the bottom of every Schmopera page.

So readers, enjoy the rest of your summer, and we'll be back in full-swing come September.
