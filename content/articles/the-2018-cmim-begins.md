short_description: Competitions are a funny thing. They demand a different set of
  skills than a performance in an opera or recital, and with the CMIM&#039;s expanded,
  online audience, the pressure for perfection is at its peak. A competition doesn&#039;t
  always give a good indication of what a singer does well - they may be an entirely
  different beast in performance-mode - but it&#039;s a fascinating snapshot into
  what a singer is doing at a specific point in their career.

This year's [Concours musical international de Montréal](https://concoursmontreal.ca/en/the-competitions/voice/) is upon us, and 2018 marks its seventh edition dedicated to voice. Known in the industry "The Montréal Competition", the CMIM brings together [38 singers from around the world](https://concoursmontreal.ca/en/the-competitions/voice/) to compete for $270,000 in prizes - including two $30,000 First Prizes in each of the Aria and Art Song divisions.

On top of prize money, the CMIM offers to all its competitors a decent amount of public exposure; the competition rounds are [broadcast live online](http://concoursmontreal.ca/en/LIVE/) for the world to see. That's a good thing, considering the exhaustive amount of [repertoire](https://concoursmontreal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cmim_Chant18-prog_F9_web.pdf) each competitor is required to bring - three rounds' worth, with very few repeats allowed.

Competitions are a funny thing. They demand a different set of skills than a performance in an opera or recital, and with the CMIM's expanded, online audience, the pressure for perfection is at its peak. A competition doesn't always give a good indication of what a singer does well - they may be an entirely different beast in performance-mode - but it's a fascinating snapshot into what a singer is doing at a specific point in their career.

Schmopera is excited to join the fun this year. We'll be heading to Montréal to catch live the Semi-Final and Final rounds of the Aria division. Some of the singers are familiar to us, like "techie tenor" [Andrew Haji](/talking-with-singers-andrew-haji/); [Rihab Chaieb](/spotlight-on-rihab-chaieb/), the mezzo who used to sing heavy metal; and "voracious knitter" [Lauren Margison](/scene/people/lauren-margison/).

Most of this year's CMIM competitors, we'll hear for the first time, and their stories make for an enticing introduction to their singing. Ukrainian soprano **Ruslana Koval** loves to cook, and her signature [borscht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht) was a hit at the Bolshoi Theater; soprano **Suzanne Taffot**, representing Canada and Cameroon, is a practicing lawyer who specializes in immigration, family, and civil rights; Finnish baritone **Tomi Pukeri** is a self-proclaimed "Nutella enthusiast"; American tenor **David Tayloe** has a fourth-degree black belt in karate; and baritone **Julien Van Mellaerts** once had a summer job as Santa Claus in the 30-degree heat of his hometown of Auckland, NZ.

If you're like us, you'll be tuning in to the [live broadcasts](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode) of this year's CMIM, and following closely with the hashtag **#CMIM2018**.
