[A few months ago](/michael-park-on-opera-disease/), we spoke with pianist and composer [Michael Park](/scene/people/michael-park/) about his new one-act, interactive chamber opera, [*Diagnosis: Diabetes*](/michael-park-on-opera-disease/). Since [our interview](/michael-park-on-opera-disease/), Park has seen the workshop premiere of his opera with Vancouver's [Erato Ensemble](/scene/companies/erato-ensemble/), and received the first audience feedback from the performance. Many listeners were new to opera in general, and even more were there to learn about this unique perspective on experiencing life with diabetes. 

Park is eager to share the positive reception to [*Diagnosis: Diabetes*](http://www.michaelpark.ca/diabetes-presskit) with our readers, and with companies and organizations who may be interested in presenting future performances of this audience-friendly, educational, and interactive work. Have a look, and please share generously.
