Readers, we're beyond excited to introduce our latest development over here at Schmopera.

We've been around for almost two years; we take pride in offering you news, interviews, and closer looks at what it takes to put up opera, and to make the art thrive. We also value our clean, generally ad-free layout that focuses on content rather than clickbait.  Although it's a labour of love, operating a blog like this is no small feat. 

That's why, instead of cluttering your experience with ads, we've opted instead to open the [Schmopera Store](https://www.facebook.com/pg/schmopera/shop/), where you can shop for unique opera-centric apparel. Our T-shirts and hoodies are designed by the Schmopera team, from one set of opera nerds to another. We're offering T-shirts for $35 CAD, and hoodies for $55; that may seem a tad steep, but do keep in mind that the items are great quality, and the design is totally original. Best of all, you'll be supporting our mission to inspire and challenge the evolution of opera and live music. 

Now, [go get yourself some schwag](https://www.facebook.com/pg/schmopera/shop/), and tell your friends!
