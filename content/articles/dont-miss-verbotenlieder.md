On **December 19** at Toronto's Lula Lounge, [Tongue In Cheek Productions](/scene/companies/tongue-in-cheek-productions/) presents its second tradition-defying event, *Verbotenlieder*.

Launched in 2018 by baritones Michael Nyby and Aaron Durand, TICP is about unpacking and re-thinking the "often stiff nature" of classical music. With *Verbotenlieder*, they're upending two of opera's most ubiquitous traditions: gender and voice type.

The all-women line-up of singers will offer their delightfully femininine - or maybe not? - takes on traditionally male favourites: the Weibermarsch from *The Merry Widow*, duets from *The Pearl Fishers* and *La boh√®me*, and even the Grand Inquisitor scene from *Don Carlo*.

For opera veterans, *Verbotenlieder* is sure to be a hoot; and for the newcomers, there's a programme of excellent music, sung by some of Canada's must-hear talent.
