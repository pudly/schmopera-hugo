"LGBTQ+ characters are rarely represented in the traditional repertoire TOT has presented in the past. That changes here. Out and proud composer Michael Rose, has brought a fresh, new score and libretto for TOT to share with our audiences. Our story features the heavily fraught relationship of Helen - a designer in the small hamlet of Shakespeare, Ontario - discovering her closeted husband's secret; and how they come to terms with each other, their past, and their future. 

"We also meet Taylor, the fabulous, skilled, and proudly gay dressmaker who brings Helen's creations to life. The Aurora Borealis are very important to everyone in this little hamlet, but they hold a tragic yet endearing significance for TOT's first gay character. TOT's fabulous, skilled, and proudly gay favourite Gregory Finney (he/him) steps into these historic shoes."

"Representation matters. New works matter. Canadian works matter. We are proud to have the honour and privilege to give space to these characters and voices - and relish the opportunity to do more in the future."
