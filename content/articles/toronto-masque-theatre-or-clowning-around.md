Last night I went for the first time to see [Toronto Masque Theatre](http://www.torontomasquetheatre.com/), who are in the middle of their 11th season. I don't know much bout the [masque tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masque), but I've learned that it was most popular in the 16th and early 17th centuries, and combined music, acting, dancing, and even architecture into a piece of theatre meant to flatter the man paying for all of it. _So You Want To Write A Masque_? was a fun look at how this art form comes together. The music was provided by soprano [Michele DeBoer](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/choir/bios/michele-deboer), lutenist [Lucas Harris](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/bios/lucas-harris), and violinist and "maestro" [Larry Beckwith](http://www.torontomasquetheatre.com/node/9), who is also the founder and Artistic Director of Toronto Masque Theatre. The acting, dancing, and architecture were covered by improv clown duo Nicholas DÃ©noument and Mina Kalishnikova of the [Gorgonetrevitch Corps de Ballet Nationale](http://whetstoneproductions.com/Whetstone_Productions/Bethany.html) (true names: [David-Benjamin Tomlinson](http://whetstoneproductions.com/Whetstone_Productions/David_Bio.html) and [Diana Kolpak](http://www.dianakolpak.ca/Bio.html)). 

As a newcomer to Toronto Masque Theatre, I doubt that _So You Want To Write A Masque?_ is indicative of the rest of their season. I still had fun in what was a quasi-staged, quasi-improvised unfurling of a masque, complete with audience volunteers, and a makeshift set of scarves, chairs, and hand puppets. Nicholas and Mina were hilarious as the disruptive clown troupe, interrupting a pleasant night of Renaissance and Baroque music. Beckwith, DeBoer, and Harris were a fantastic trio, both musically, and in accommodating the unruly demands of the pushy clowns. The improv factor was exciting, since I realized it had been a _long_ time since I'd really seen that live; at times the delivery was corny, and the audience members seemed less than enthusiastic about their involvement in the masque. Still, I think its a good idea that I hope will start to reach younger listeners; I think a sense of humour is a perfect bridge between arguably obscure music and its potential audience.
