This week, [Nashville Opera](/scene/companies/nashville-opera/) opens its "strikingly visual" production of [*Don Giovanni*](http://www.nashvilleopera.org/don-giovanni), starring baritone David Adam Moore in the title role.

"Audiences should look forward to experiencing a roller-coaster ride of powerful emotions," says John Hoomes, Artistic Director of Nasvhille Opera and the director of this *Giovanni*. "Mozart did his very best to pack this opera with extreme contrasts - light comedy suddenly melts into searing drama, playful romance gives way to sensuality and yearning, and every moment is heightened by the brilliant music of Mozart."

*Don Giovanni* starts a [curious season at Nashville Opera](http://www.nashvilleopera.org/season-1/), which also includes Bizet's [*Carmen*](http://www.nashvilleopera.org/carmen), Tom Cipullo's [*Glory Denied*](http://www.nashvilleopera.org/glory-denied), and the world premiere of Robert Paterson's [*Three Way*](http://www.nashvilleopera.org/three-way), a trio of one-acts ("Think *Sex and the City* meets *The Twilight Zone*," say Nashville Opera).

Next to the the contemporary half of Nashville's season, Hoomes is passionate about the lasting relevance of *Don Giovanni*. "Although written over 200 years ago, our production of *Don Giovanni* remains incredibly relevant to the world today," he says. "I feel the audience will love how intense and dramatic the show can be, while also being incredibly funny - often at the same time. Mozart's original intent was to create a dramatic experience with lots of jokes sprinkled in, and he certainly succeeded."

*Don Giovanni* plays October 6 and 8 at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center's Andrew Jackson Hall, so [click here for details and tickets](http://www.nashvilleopera.org/don-giovanni) while there's still time.
