This week in Toronto, you can catch a performance of "one of the most radical and inventive Canadian works created in the past half-century", at Soundstreams' latest innovative concert, *Odditorium*, happening **March 2-5th** at Crow's Theatre, 345 Carlaw Ave.

*Amente-Nufe*, *Crown of Ariadne*, *Tantrika*, and *La testa d'Adriana* are the four selections from R. Murray Schafer's 12-piece musical/theatrical cycle, *Patria*, which will be presented in a newly-realized performance directed by Chris Abraham, with music direction by the contemporary musical guru himself, Dr. John Hess. 

*Patria* is written over a 40-year period, and it "consists of a cycle of 12 music-theatre works featuring a labyrinth of sideshows, lovers, buskers, and Tantric experts."

Performing Schafer's music are stellar singers [Carla Huhtanen](/scene/people/carla-huhtanen/) and [Andrea Ludwig](/scene/people/andrea-ludwig/) are joined by harpist Judy Loman, accordionist Joseph Macerollo, percussionists Ryan Scott and Dan Morphy, and dancers/choreographers Andrea Nann and Brendan Wyatt.

*Odditorium* has six performances between **March 2-5th** at 8pm and 10pm. Tickets start at $22, and you can get them at the [Crow's Theatre website](https://tickets.crowstheatre.com/TheatreManager/1/login?event=94). Plus, opera lovers can get a special ticket offer with the promo code **Ariadne35**, which gives you $35 tickets in the B-level.
