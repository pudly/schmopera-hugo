[Did you know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patter_song) that the word "patter" comes from the Catholic "Pater Noster," which was apparently recited as fast as possible by the congregation? 

Equal in hilarity to the image of a monotone group of Catholics speeding through holy texts out of sheer rote/boredom are all the "patter songs" that steal the show in opera and music theatre. Here are some of our favourites:

## "Ã€ un dottor della mia sorte"

If you're looking for patter, Rossini's operas are a prime place to start. A Mount Everest of sorts for basses and bass-baritones, Don Bartolo's aria from *Il barbiere di Siviglia* demands mind-numbing speed that even Italians have to practice. We love Alfonso Antoniozzi's performance from La Scala in 1999. Big breath...and go!

## "My eyes are fully open to this awful situation"

If it's not Rossini, the stars of patter are Misters Gilbert & Sullivan. Sure, there's the whole "I am the very model of a modern Major General" bit, but patter seems to get even funnier when there are more people involved. So, check out the trio from G&S' *Ruddigore*, where you'll hear one of our favourite lines from a show: "This particularly rapid, unintelligible patter isn't generally heard, and if it is, it doesn't matter."

## "Udite, udite, o rustici"

Back *in italiano*, Donizetti takes a cue from Rossini with Dulcamara's aria from *L'elisir d'amore*. Just like [Harold Hill in *The Music Man*](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi8iJnIgq3OAhXJAsAKHXsgCJcQyCkIITAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLI_Oe-jtgdI&usg=AFQjCNGYi2ZqXQN-pXbJrnjg-AstSAkRxw&sig2=u0PZTYtcErc6uAp_4DiszA), the shameless salesman lures a crowd of small-townsfolk with  the (literally) unbelievable list of health benefits they can get from drinking his "elixir". (Spoiler: it's really just wine, arguably another cure-all.)

## "(Not) Getting Married Today"

Sondheim, that master of words and all-too-real moments of humanity, also sees the comedic possibilities in patter songs. Brilliantly delivered by Carol Burnett, Sondheim captures a bride-to-be's pre-wedding panic:

## "Look at me now" (cover by Karmin)

Just to give you all a taste of a 21st-century patter song, have a listen to this cover of Chris Brown's "Look at me now" (feat. Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes) by Amy & Nick of [Karmin](http://www.karminmusic.com/). Four lungs, Amy has.
