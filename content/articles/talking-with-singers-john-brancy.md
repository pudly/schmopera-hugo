  Fresh off a recording session for his new album with pianist Peter Dugan, [*A Silent Night*](http://www.johnbrancy.com/asilentnight), baritone John Brancy relishes the chance to take a break from the opera stage, and spend time with art song.

  Luckily, Brancy returns next week to the New York Festival of Song for [*Rodgers, Rodgers & Guettel: A Century of American Musical Theater*](http://nyfos.org/Rodgers.html)  November 1 and 3 at the Kaufman Music Center's Merkin Concert Hall. Brancy will perform with Tony Award-nominated singers Lauren Worsham and Mary Testa, tenor Hal Cazalet, and pianists Steven Blier and Michael Barrett, singing the music of Richard Rodgers (*Oklahoma!*, *The King and I*), his daughter Mary Rodgers (*One Upon A Mattress*), and his grandson Adam Guettel (*A Light in the Piazza*).

  Brancy is also hosting this week's ["Song of the Day" series](http://blog.nyfos.org/category/song-of-the-day) on the NYFOS blog, where his picks include [Poulenc's "Priez pour paix"](http://blog.nyfos.org/3324-2) and [Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Soliloquy"](http://blog.nyfos.org/rodgers-hammerstein-soliloquy-carousel) from *Carousel*

  We spoke with Brancy about his upcoming *A Silent Night* with Peter Dugan, why he loves his work with the New York Festival of Song, and how he keeps healthy enough to make it all happen.
