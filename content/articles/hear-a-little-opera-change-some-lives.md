This Friday, October 23rd, at Heliconian Hall, "Duelling Divas" Kathleen Promane, mezzo-soprano, and [Allison Arends](/scene/people/allison-arends/), soprano, present a concert full of arias and duets. Pianist [Maika'i Nash](/scene/people/maikai-nash/) joins the two ladies, who will be looking very bejeweled indeed with accessories by designer [Catherine Sequalino-Poitier](http://www.csp-studiosequalino.com/). The concert is at 7:30pm at Heliconian Hall; tickets are $25 at the door and $20 in advance, available by [email](mailto:allison@allisonarends.com) phone (647-833-5400).

What's notable about this concert comes afterwards; along with a reception, Allison and Kathleen will be joined by tenor [Paul Williamson](/scene/people/paul-williamson/), to talk about the three singers' *Mini Mozarts Summer Camp* initiative. The camp offers music education (and fun times, of course) to underprivileged kids in Kingston, Jamaica. It's a great thing to do, and we'll be talking more about *Mini Mozarts* in the near future.

For now, get to know some of these singers in concert on Friday night. For details and tickets, follow the box office links below.
