preamble: You may have caught a recent series of posts by composer [Frank Pesci](/authors-frank-pesci/),
  about the complicated and vulnerable process of workshopping new opera. In a recent
  [interview](http://www.makeweirdmusic.com/discover/frank-pesci/) with Anthony Garone
  of [Make Weird Music](http://www.makeweirdmusic.com/), Pesci talks about the operatic
  myths that may keep potential audiences at arm's length, the influence of jazz in
  his music - and its value for classical musicians - and his own "heroes" of contemporary
  opera.
