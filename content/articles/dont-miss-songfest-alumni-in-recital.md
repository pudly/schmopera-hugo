Coming next week to the National Opera Center: alumni of [*SongFest*](/scene/companies/songfest/) present their Emerging Artist Recital, **December 7, 7pm** in Marc A. Scorca Hall. *SongFest* has an impressive roster of artists - both professional and pre-professional - who ensure the future of art song through high-quality training and unique performance opportunities. Each June is *SongFest*'s [summer institute](http://www.songfest.us/institute/programs/), held at the Colburn School in Los Angeles, and their annual [winter intensive](http://www.songfest.us/new-winter-intensive-in-hidden-valley/) happens in California's Carmel Valley.

The upcoming recital features *SongFest*'s Marc & Eva Stern Fellows, and the event will be live-streamed at operaamerica.org/Live. Onstage you'll hear sopranos [Helen Zhibing Huang](https://twitter.com/singingchirpy) and [Anne Wright](/scene/people/anne-wright/), mezzo-sopranos [Emily D'Angelo](/scene/people/emily-dangelo/) and [Simone McIntosh](/scene/people/simone-mcintosh/) (go Canada!), tenor [Ian McEuen](/scene/people/ian-mceuen/), baritone [Josh Quinn](/scene/people/josh-quinn/), and pianists Dimitri Dover, Liza Stepanova, and You Zhao.

The programme is a fantastic mix of top-shelf art song by Poulenc, Schubert, Zemlinsky, Marx, Turina, and Berg, alongside works by *SongFest* featured composers Tom Cipullo and Jake Heggie. Plus, there are a few tastes of the artists' operatic work, including the delicious final trio from *Der Rosenkavalier*.
