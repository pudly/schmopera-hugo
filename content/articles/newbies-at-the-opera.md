Being more of a rock/indie concert-goer, and the occasional Broadway musical, I had never been to a proper opera before. All I knew about opera was from Saturday morning cartoons - ["Kill Da Wabbit"](http://store.schmopera.com/) comes to mind.  When the opportunity came up to see an opera (and a classic at that, [*The Marriage of Figaro*](/in-review-the-marriage-of-figaro/)), I couldn’t say no.

It was my first time at the COC and I was in awe. It was lovely to see people dressed up (I now wish I had worn a tie), and the anticipation in the air was electrifying - it could’ve been my own excitement being an opera virgin, I didn’t know what to expect.

We entered the theatre and got to our seats minutes before the curtain rose. The stage set was simple and yet magnificent with a full staircase as the main backdrop, and then the orchestra started and the singing began, WOW! The voices. I never thought operas could be so humorous and enjoyable, I always thought operas were serious and tragic with the cliché of a fat lady in a flowing floor-length  gown and horned helmet - was I wrong!

The show was so enjoyable I didn’t see the time go by – and I was so happy to see the English surtitles way above, so that someone like me, not knowing much about the story, could follow.

Would I like to see another opera? Of course!

By the way, which opera has the fat lady in a horned helmet?
