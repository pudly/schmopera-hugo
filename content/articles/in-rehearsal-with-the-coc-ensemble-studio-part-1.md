In one week from today, the young artists of the Canadian Opera Company will grace the stage of the Four Seasons Centre as they present their [unique performance](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/CosiFanTutte/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx) of Mozart's _Così fan tutte_. The Ensemble Studio has been putting in some serious time to get this show on its feet, and I was lucky enough to get a few moments to talk with the cast. Below is the first of a three-part video series, where we meet the four young singers who sing the roles of the lovers in Act I.

Check back soon for Part Two, where we’ll meet four more lovers from Act II. Looking forward to the show? Let us know why in the comments below!
