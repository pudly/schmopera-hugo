There is no getting around what this stirring scene that opens Richard Strauss’

opera Der Rosenkavalier is all about. Everything in the music depicts a morning of

frantic and illicit rumpy-pumpy between the Marschallin and her younger lover Count

Octavian. The music is full of passionate swing and, well, everything that goes with

such an occasion. Since Richard Strauss orchestrates the opening here so richly, it is

crucial to constantly reference the score as you are preparing it, and listen as widely as

you can to various versions. Whenever I have encountered this scene in an audition

context, I have usually only had to play as far as the first vocal entry of the opera ‘wie

du warst’ (Octavian basically saying ‘sex with you is great’, though in my version the

English is rather prudishly translated, which I suppose fits the stereotypes of our

national character.) This usually makes it the only scene where you don’t have to sing

as you play, unless you are asked to go further (usually until Figure 27 at the latest). 

> The richness of this string section is immense and thick, perfectly placed to conjure the thrilling world of swirling passions

Before anything else I would take a look at the orchestral score. What must leap out at you is how rich the string section is here; Strauss demands sixteen first violins, sixteen second violins, twelve violas, ten cellos and a whopping eight double basses. The richness of this string section is immense and thick, perfectly placed to conjure the thrilling world of swirling passions, though a world away from our noble piano, with its rather paltry three strings per note.  

Strauss' marking "Stürmisch bewegt" can be translated to English in many ways, meaning moving either stormily, tumultuously, boisterously, or my favourite, rapturously. However you play this opening, it must capture this fervent passion in character, and you must try and find how to move as this immense string section would while also channelling the characters of the other instruments. 

The opening horn call gives you the perfect chance to do this, and you can double the first note in the bass to represent the pizzicato of the cellos and double basses if you like. One of my colleagues recently told me how a teacher of his once demonstrated how the entire first seven bars could be played just with the left hand, though I tend to play it safe and use both to find the sound I need. The horn’s accented notes are usually a little held back whenever they come, and you must work hard to find the sound in the second bar. Though in the piano score we simply see "forte" in bar one, changing to fortissimo in bar two, the full sound of the orchestral entry shown in the orchestral score means this moment will have a very strong impact.
