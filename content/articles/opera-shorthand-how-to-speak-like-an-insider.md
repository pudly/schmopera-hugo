  Industry jargon is one of those things that can set the professionals apart from the amateurs, and opera is full of shop-talk. Using the term, "choir" instead of "chorus" can signal someone's (benevolent and innocent) ignorance about the group of singers often found on opera stages; conversely, using the terms "Sitz" or "Wandel" instead of simply "rehearsal" denotes a specific level of operatic in-the-know.

  Aside from terminology like *da capo* and *messa di voce* - which aren't necessarily thrown around in casual chats between opera lovers - a lot of that industry jargon centres around the titles of famous operas.

## Drop that article

If you pay attention, you'll notice that the first thing to go around opera-savvy folk are the articles in an opera's title. In general, we don't really say, "*La bohème*," "*Il trovatore*", or "*La fille du régiment*." If someone uses that "il" or "der" or any other form of "the," it has shades of meaning, suggesting that the person speaking doesn't quite have these opera titles at the front of their brains.

So, if you want to fit in better with that intermission conversation, switch out "*La Cenerentola*" with just, "*Cenerentola*". Like "Facebook," versus, "The Facebook." 

## One-word operas

Often, opera titles get whittled down to one indicative word in the full title. Instead of *The Magic Flute*, it's just *Flute*, the same way it's just *Ballo*, not *Un ballo in maschera*. *Così* rarely needs the *fan tutte* in general conversation, *Fanciulla* will do without the *del West*, and *The Turn of the* is redundant when we're talking about *Screw*. It's *Dialogues*, but no *Carmélites*, *Elixir* with an assumption of *Love*, and one can just say *Rake*, with the *Progress* implied. *Die Enführung aus dem Serail* becomes simply, *Abduction*, and *Suor* will do without the *Angelica*. 

And of course, the confusion between two great operas based on Beaumarchais' Figaro are simply known colloquially as *Nozze* and *Barber*.

## Last-name basis

Lots of operas are named after their main characters; for some reason, saying them both just feels clunky to opera folks. With a couple of exceptions like *Lucia (di Lammermoor)* and *Tristan (und Isolde)*, most of the name titles get shortened to simply the surname in casual conversation. There's *Cesare* (no Giulio), *Schicchi* (no Gianni) *Grimes* (no Peter), and *Giovanni* (no Don); often there's not even a Madama in *Butterfly*. Shows like *Les contes d'Hoffmann* or *The Rape of Lucretia* become *Hoffmann* and *Lucretia*; and those Tudor operas by Donizetti are simply known as, *Bolena*, *Stuarda*, and *Devereux*.

## Be cool with nicknames

It may seem counter-intuitive, but shortened titles and nicknames like these speak to someone's opera know-how more than beautifully pronouncing the correct title in the opera's original language. Holding fast to an opera's title in its original language - proudly showing off the nasal [o] in *Manon* or your loveliest umlaut in *Die Zauberflöte* - can scream of trying too hard.

Organically, there can arise little pet names for some of our favourite operas. Some of them are simply lazy, like "Trav" instead of *La traviata*, or "D.G." instead of *Don Giovanni*, and somewhere along the road, "Rosenkav" became an acceptable industry term for Richard Strauss' *Der Rosenkavalier*. 

(Insider's tip: some of the nicknames are just bad puns - both in quality and subject matter - like "The Battered Broad" for Smetana's *The Bartered Bride*, and even the classic, "Dildo and Anus" for *Dido and Aeneas*.)
