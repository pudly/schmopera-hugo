<h3>1. Manon<br>
</h3>
<p>
	Oddly, thinking of Manon at an opera was what got me on the topic to begin with. I figure that Manon would want to see something that glamourizes life and life's difficult decisions. She'd probably <em>just die</em> for the chance to see <em>Tosca</em>; Manon would find fabulous common ground with the fellow diva who fights for her man. I bet Manon would love herself a good <em>La traviata</em>, too; her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sz2mpzYjcI" target="_blank">Gavotte</a> is a fair comparison to Violetta's "Sempre libera", after all. Oh, and Berg's <em>Lulu</em>.
</p>
<h3>2. Papageno</h3>
<p>
	How cute would he be, flitting around from usher to usher, trying to find his seat? He'd probably jump at tickets for <em>Hänsel und Gretel</em>, what with all the food and magic (hopefully we caught the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMuEwhw97RI" target="_blank">Met's 2008 production</a> with the tongue-house and the big-headed chefs!). If he's feeling melancholy, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flVBOlBg_tg" target="_blank">which sometimes happens</a>, I bet Papageno would love <em>Rusalka</em>; he'd empathize with her non-human status and her quest for true love. I picture him drying his eyes with his feathers.
</p>
<h3>3. Suzuki</h3>
<p>
	Wise, loving, and probably charmingly conservative, Suzuki would probably only treat herself to one opera a year. I bet it would be <em>Dialogues des Carmélites</em>. Sounds weird, but if anyone understands faith, hope, and honour, <a href="/talking-with-singers-elizabeth-deshong/" target="_blank">it would be Suzuki</a>. I think she'd find something to love about most of the women in the opera, save for Sister Blanche (Suzuki and I have that in common). Although <em>Dialogues</em> doesn't offer up a happy ending that someone like Suzuki might crave, at least there are some rationally thinking women involved. Sorry, Cio-Cio San.
</p>
<h3>4. Werther</h3>
<p>
	Easy. He'd be curled up in a partially obstructed seat for <em>Eugene Onegin</em>, where he could wrestle with the idea that Onegin's torment just may be greater than his own. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFgMowOwek0" target="_blank">Sondheim, anyone?</a>) For catharsis, there's always <em>Otello </em>or <em>Peter Grimes</em> to remind Werther he shouldn't trust anyone ever. I want to say that, on his good days, Werther would go and see <em>La bohème</em>, because of the poet factor, but I'm sure it would send him into a spiral of despair that can't even be described by the most compound of German words.
</p>
<h3>5. Don Giovanni</h3>
<p>
	<em>Don Giovanni</em>, natch. Sociopathic narcissist, anyone? Maybe <em>Falstaff</em> for a laugh, because Giovanni could still dream of growing up to be Sir John.
