short_description: Pianists who work with singers tend to pride themselves on being

  wants a friendly push in tempo. Yet just as married-for-decades couples can still
  manage to surprise each other, even the best of pianist-singer relationships aren&#039;t
  perfectly telepathic.

title: What do singers want in a pianist?

There was an [interesting post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opera/comments/6yr54h/tipsguidelines_on_working_with_an_opera_singer/?st=j7c2x21w&sh=b72b8f1b) the other day, from a pianist asking for some beginner's tips on working with a singer. Presumably coming from singers or more experienced coaches, some of the comments mentioned: 
<ul class="nospace">
<li> the importance of translating foreign-language texts,
<li>knowing some basics of diction (arguably a bit of a can of worms), 
<li>policing the singer's pitch and rhythmic accuracy, 
<li>figuring out where the singer will breathe, and
<li>breathing with them when they do.
</ul>

It's a good list, even if each item inevitably branches off into a life-long pursuit of its own. A pianist who sticks to this list is certainly more valuable to a singer than a pianist who doesn't, but grasping the basics doesn't necessarily make for an indispensable partner.

Pianists who work with singers tend to pride themselves on being an anticipator of needs. A great pianist seems to know before the singer does if they need an emergency breath, could use some extra hang-time on a high note, or wants a friendly push in tempo. Yet just as married-for-decades couples can still manage to surprise each other, even the best of pianist-singer relationships aren't perfectly telepathic.

The question has us thinking: what is it that singers really want - even need - in their pianists? Do they want an agile dance partner of sorts, who stays flexible and ready to follow a singer's lead? Do they want backbone, even resistance in their music-making? Do they want a pianist who will err on the faster side of a tempo? Do they want more left hand? Quieter page turns?

Readers, we know that there are singers among you. So, we're sending the questions your way: 

What do you want in a pianist? And how can pianists make themselve indispensable to singers?
