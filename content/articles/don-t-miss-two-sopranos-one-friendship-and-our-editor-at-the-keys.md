Toronto-area readers, we've got a rare opportunity for you:

Happening **June 1, 7pm** at Oakville's [St. John's United Church](http://stjohnsunited.ca/events-calendar/), you can catch _Two Sopranos, One Friendship_, a concert featuring sopranos (and best friends) [Aviva Fortunata](/scene/people/aviva-fortunata/) and [Claire de Sévigné](/claire-de-sevigne-sing-fast-high/). Plus! At the piano is [Jenna Simeonov](/authors/jenna) (me), founder and editor of Schmopera, out and about and likely wearing lipstick.

It's a one-night-only event that celebrates high notes, illicit duets, and comedy banter to rival the days of Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews. There will be a Mozart sing-off, more than one medley, and some stunning singing from two of Canada's most exciting young stars. (I promise; I've heard it in rehearsal.)

Tickets are $40, and you can get them by emailing [office@stjohnsunited.ca](mailto:office@stjohnsunited.ca), or at the door. We'd love to see you there!
