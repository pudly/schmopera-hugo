Last month, fellow colleague and buddy Cameron McPhail was [named a winner](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/george-london-vocal-contest-recognizes-american-and-canadian-singers/?_php=true&_type=blogs&smid=tw-nytimesmusic&seid=auto&_r=0) of the [George London Foundation Awards Competition](http://georgelondon.org/?page_id=57). Way to go, Cam! I asked the [COC Ensemble Studio member](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx) how it felt:

> I love competing... at sports. Because it doesn't matter what it looks like, what technique they use, who they know... If you're the fastest, the time decides who wins, or you win a boxing match if you outlast your opponent, not if you chose the right trainer or wore the best colour of trunks. As singers, we compete because it's another way to help your career, make new friends and sharpen your craft in a different context. If anything, it's a tool for polishing your audition package, because it's a completely inorganic, unnatural experience for most of us. Some singers just function well in the crook of a piano in their suit or day dress. I'm learning.

To ask Cam what he's doing with his prize money, bug him at [@Cameron_McPhail](https://twitter.com/Cameron_McPhail). Congrats, darlin'!
