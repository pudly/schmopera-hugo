Yesterday I [posted an article](/in-defence-of-singers/) about how hard it is for singers to stay creative and stay employed. Just over 24hrs later, close to 12,000 people have read it, and some have left some pretty brilliant and moving [comments](/in-defence-of-singers/#lower-jump). While I was writing it, I fought several strong urges to delete the whole thing. I'm so glad I didn't, because it's clear that my own personal hunches are shared by plenty of us.

So, thanks to all of you for reading Schmopera. And thank you allÂ for assuring me, an inside informant, that this industry is ready for revival and ready to say something new.

Bravi, tutti!
