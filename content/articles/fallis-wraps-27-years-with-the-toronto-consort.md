After 27 years with The Toronto Consort, David Fallis will conduct his [final performances as Artistic Director](https://torontoconsort.org/concerts-tickets/2017-18-a-season-to-celebrate/monteverdis-orfeo/) this month. **May 25-27** at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre, the Consort presents [Monteverdi's *Orfeo*](https://torontoconsort.org/concerts-tickets/2017-18-a-season-to-celebrate/monteverdis-orfeo/), featuring English tenor Charles Daniels in the title role.

Fallis has made considerable contributions to Toronto's Early Music Scene. With The Toronto Consort, he has led staged, semi-staged, and concert performances of all three operas by Monteverdi, and works by Cavalli and Carissimi. 

[*Orfeo*](https://torontoconsort.org/concerts-tickets/2017-18-a-season-to-celebrate/monteverdis-orfeo/), a story about music's power to make great things happen, and "the first great opera", is a fitting finale to Fallis' tenure as Artistic Director. 

Readers, **we're giving away two pairs of tickets to the matinee performance on May 27 (3:30pm)**. To be eligible for the draw, share or retweet this post (give us a tag @Schmopera, too!) and tell us why you're keen to see *Orfeo* with one of Toronto's cornerstones of Early Music. We'll **draw a winner on Wednesday, May 23**.
