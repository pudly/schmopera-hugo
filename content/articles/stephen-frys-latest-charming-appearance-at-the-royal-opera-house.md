I think this event was a groundbreaking step forward in making opera accessible to a new generation. Moderated by our favourite Stephen Fry, the [Intelligence²](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/) debate was whether Richard Wagner or Giuseppe Verdi reigned as an operatic master. With columnist/blogger [Norman Lebrecht](http://www.normanlebrecht.com/) backing Verdi and novelist [Philip Hensher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hensher) vouching for Wagner, the debate was part of a celebration of the 200th birthday of both composers. It also features some great performances by young operatic talent, most notably Dušica Biljelić's performance of Desdemona's aria from Verdi's _Otello_ (begins at 35:00).

> Verdi comes off as a man of the people, while Wagner gets everyone thinking.

This wasn't a debate in the sense that one side was expected to win; everyone involved acknowledged that the question was not to be as rudimentary as, "Whose operas were better?"  The conversation came down to this: what matters more in art, the head or the heart? Verdi comes off as a man of the people, while Wagner gets everyone thinking. The role of power seems to be polar between the two; Verdi makes heroes out of those who stood up to figures of power (think, Aida, Alfredo), and Wagner starts with heroes in the first place (think Siegfried, Lohengrin) Despite a few unnecessary reminders that Wagner wrote unfriendly things about the Jews, and that Verdi conversely wrote them a great [chorus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzCVhQb-UMY), it was an interesting chat that included listeners responses from social media. It's definitely worth a watch:

Personal note: I still have a soft spot for Verdi. The aria on repeat in my earbuds these days is the _Miserere_ from _Il trovatore_. I like [this performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHkgAcmLslk).

For more opera fun with Fry, check out his [The Science of Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVN4dShaZWk), where he and comedian Alan Davies go to the opera, and scientists measure their emotional reactions. Super cool.

And here he is talking about the [Tristan chord](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWLp7lBomW8).
