As a thank-you to its loyal audience, the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](/scene/companies/toronto-symphony-orchestra/) and Music Director Peter Oundjian are presenting a *free concert* at Roy Thomson Hall, July 7th at 12:30pm. The concert is a generous closing to a packed 2014/15 season at the TSO, which included Lang Lang's at the 2nd annual Chinese New Year Celebration, Emanuel Ax curating the RBC Piano Extravaganza, and the North American première of George Benjamin's opera, *Written on Skin*, starring the incomparable [Barbara Hannigan](/scene/people/barbara-hannigan/).

What's on the free program? Selections from Holst's *The Planets*, Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Stravinsky's *Firebird Suite* and more. 

Seating is by general admission, on a first-come, first-served basis. [Click here](http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/Thank-You-Toronto.aspx) for details and the full concert program.
