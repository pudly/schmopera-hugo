Coming up in Toronto next month: two Canadian singers team up in recital. Tenor [Adrian Kramer](https://twitter.com/aitkramer), soprano [Lucia Cesaroni](http://luciacesaroni.com/#) and pianist [Maika'i Nash](http://maikai.ca/biography/) present _Extensions of Us: Melody and Movement. _"Featuring singing and dancing to Verdi, Mascagni, Canzoni Napoletane, and selections from _West Side Story,_ the program promises to delight both seasoned and new concert-goers as it re-thinks the traditional recital format."

You probably know Adrian and Maika'i from [Opera 5](/in-review-offenbachhahn/) shows, and Lucia just wrapped up a production of [_Das Rheingold_](http://www.pov.bc.ca/bios/cesaroni.html) at Pacific Opera Victoria. It'll be a rare chance to catch two rising Canadian singers (and one fab pianist) share one stage. _Extensions of Us_ happens on November 13th at 8pm, at the Extension Room (30 Eastern Ave). It's a cool space for what looks like a special concert. Tickets are $30, $20 for students. Get yours [right here](http://luciacesaroni.com/#upcoming)!
