  Canadian baritone [Alexander Hajek](/scene/people/alexander-hajek/) has taken stages on both sides of the Atlantic, from the [Canadian Opera Company](/scene/companies/canadian-opera-company/) and [l'Opéra de Montréal](/scene/companies/lopera-de-montreal/) to the [Semperoper Dresden](/scene/people/semperoper-dresden/), Oper Stuttgart, and the [Royal Opera House](/scene/companies/royal-opera-house/), Covent Garden. His staple roles include Count Almaviva in *Le nozze di Figaro*, Schaunard in *La bohème*, and the men of *Don Giovanni*, and this fall he heads to [Atlanta Opera](/scene/companies/atlanta-opera/) to sing Lt. Gordon in Kevin Puts's *Silent Night*.

  Hajek chats about the checklist he has for "good singing," and making artistic use of the "inevitable suffering" in life.

## Why do you sing, and why are you doing it professionally?

I sing because I must. It started after spending grade two in the hospital for throat cancer. (Ironic, right?) After that, it went *The Little Mermaid* in the theatres (a dozen times), *Phantom of the Opera*, *Les Misérables*, St. Michael's Choir School, voice lessons at the Royal Conservatory, saw my first *Bohème* at the Canadian Opera Company, (I ended up covering in that SAME production many years later), then the Juilliard School. 

It was never a conscious choice to sing for a living, I've literally been singing for as long as I can remember. And I'm rubbish at math, so that's why I picked the job that only requires counting to four.

## What does "good singing" mean to you? What does it feel like when you achieve it?

For "good" singing, I use a few benchmarks to keep myself in check.  After the curtain goes down, is my voice in good enough shape to do the whole thing again?  Did I manage to make the audience laugh AND cry? Did I discover a deeper truth about the piece or myself?  

On the nights that these are achieved, I can only describe it as having made love, won a gold medal, and solved world hunger\*, all wrapped up in one.

\*which would only cost 30 billion, what's the hold up? 

##  What do young singers need to do more of? What should they do less of?

My advice for younger singers (just what they don't need, another opinion): 

Focus on developing who you are as a person as much as you do your instrument. It's a hard balance to achieve, but you'll hear the results.  Fill your life with enriching experiences, use the inevitable suffering life brings and fill your repertoire with those moments.  Don't impress...express.

## Do you have any "bucket list" roles you'd like to sing (realistically or otherwise)?

My realistic bucket list includes Simon Boccanegra, Posa in *Don Carlo*, Eugene Onegin, and Rigoletto. I'm looking forward to singing them one day, but appreciate being taught to have patience and let the voice grow. I just sang my first Germont at 35 and I'm glad I waited. 

Semi-unrealistically I'd like to take a crack at Commendatore (so that I can say I've sung all the male roles in *Don Giovanni*), Peter Grimes, or Canio from *Pagliacci*...before I retire.  

## What do you wish you knew about singing 10 years ago?

Ten years ago it would have been helpful to know that I should stop worrying where I'll be in ten years. Live in the moment.
