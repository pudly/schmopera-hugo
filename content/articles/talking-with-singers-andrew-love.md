Baritone [Andrew Love](https://twitter.com/andrewjlove) is singer who recently succeeded in an official crossing-over between opera and musical theatre. He's sung at Calgary Opera, Pacific Opera Victoria, Saskatoon Opera and l'Opéra de Québec. On top of that, he just finished singing The Bishop and understudying the role of Javert in a run of [Cameron Mackintosh's _Les Misérables_ here in Toronto](http://www.lesmis.com/toronto/).  Andrew made time to talk with Schmopera about his experiences working in both the opera and musical theatre communities, and how the two can inform each other.
