short_description: In the second of our series of chats with cellist, baritone, and
  actor Matthew Sharp, we get into the nitty-gritty of what it means to be an interdisciplinary
  artist. Sharp chats about learning to sing and play simultaneously, and how he has
  developed the skills to create something greater than the sum of its parts, like
  his &quot;one-man, interactive musical epic for 7-year-olds and their adults&quot;,
