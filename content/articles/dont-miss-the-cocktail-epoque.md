Presented by [Off Centre Music Salon](/scene/people/off-centre-music-salon/) and hosted by [Julia Zarankin](http://offcentremusic.com/wp/?staff=julia-zarankin), *The Cocktail Époque* is a concert event featuring all things 1920s, at **Trinity-St. Paul's Centre, February 21st at 3pm**. 

[*The Cocktail Époque*](http://offcentremusic.com/wp/?event=the-cocktail-epoque&event_date=2016-02-21) is all about The Roaring Twenties: " a time of joyful abandon, perpetual motion, great clamour, unhinged experimentation. And, of course, drink." 

The music of Schoenberg, Hindemith, Berg, Weill, Gerswhin, Copland, and Paris' Les Six will be in the trusted hands of a great group of artists, including soprano [Allison Angelo](/scene/people/allison-angelo/), mezzo [Krisztina Szabó](/talking-with-singers-krisztina-szabo/), baritone [James Westman](/spotlight-on-james-westman/), pianist Jimmy Roberts, and accordionist [Joseph Macerollo](/squeezebox-at-soundstreams/). 

Off Centre Music Salon is all about presenting classical music "in an innovative atmosphere that evokes the spirit of a 19th century European salon." The beautiful Trinity-St. Paul's Centre is a great space to hear these fantastic artists, and tickets for *The Cocktail Époque* start at just $5.
