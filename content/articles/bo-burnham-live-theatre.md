If you've not done it yet, make a point to watch either or both of Bo Burnham's specials, available on Netflix (hopefully, depending on where you live).

- is it an opera?
- live theatre today
- multimedia help, but one person at its core
- great format for new opera, a running real-time narrative with snippets of music 
- honesty onstage - part of his thing, addressing every minute moment of awkwardness (the trip from centre stage to the piano, etc.) - this works because he brings people into his process, lets audience know that *he* knows shows can be weird and take work to make them flow, addressing the tricky bits about it so the audience can almost feel in on the creation
- one of his "favourite things" is Sondheim's *Sunday in the Park with George*
- YouTube channel since 2006
