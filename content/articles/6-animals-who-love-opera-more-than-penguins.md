title: "6 animals who love opera more than penguins"
---

If you haven't yet heard, there's a certain waddle of penguins (apparently it's "waddle", not "flock"!) in Antarctica that get totally freaked out by the sound of a tenor. 

\*Note: [tenor Nick Allen has removed his original upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCW878jkfv4), after getting concerned feedback from the [International Association of Antarctica Tour Operations](http://iaato.org/home). Thie video below is a repost via [Avcircles](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkHTVANNjAPmwG77KmELZwA).

So, penguins are not about the singing, it seems. [Mountain lions don't like it either.](/see-you-do-need-opera-to-survive/)

But not all wildlife is averse to the human voice. This parrot, for example, sings Mozart:

And though it's not singing, these elephants sure like to sway to the dulcet tones of the violin:

And cows? Cows love music. They seem particularly happy about [brass instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs_-emj1qR4), and these French cows are all about jazz:

Dogs not only love singing, they love joining in. This German shepherd has some pretty decent chops, actually:

There's also the little Yorkie who loves *La traviata*...

And like many of you, readers, this dog *will* cancel his nap plans if there's opera involved:
