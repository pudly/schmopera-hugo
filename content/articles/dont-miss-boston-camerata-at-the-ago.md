The Art Gallery of Ontario is presenting a collection of works entitled [*Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures*](https://www.ago.net/small-wonders-gothic-boxwood-miniatures). The collection opened on November 5, 2016 and runs through until January 22nd. 

As part of the presentation, the [Boston Camerata](http://www.bostoncamerata.org/) has been invited to perform a collection of devotional music from the 16th century. Under the direction of Anne Azéma, the period ensemble consists of four vocalists, and period instruments such as lutes, violas da gamba, vielle, harp and a hurdy gurdy. Yup. A [hurdy gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy). #HurdyGurdy

"For this program, we've selected music to match the gorgeous artifacts presented in *Small Wonders*, featuring music of personal devotion from the early Renaissance that reflects the spirituality of homes, family circles and small chapels, in an age of intense religious renewal." Says Azéma of this weekends program, "We will sing in Latin, Dutch, German, Italian and French, but don't worry, translations will be provided."

These pieces vary from the music we know today primarily by their original performance practices. "These Renaissance Flemish pieces are very different from today's music, as they were written for personal meditation, private chapels and rooms, family houses and assemblies; they weren't intended for grand cathedrals or public ceremony. Like the boxwood miniatures themselves, their craftsmanship is precise, superb; rich in subtle details, they lead us to contemplation."

Commissioned by the Art Gallery of Ontario, this weekend is presented in collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Boston Camerata; and with participation of Boston University and you have two chances to see it. **Saturday, January 14th** and **Sunday, January 15th**. You can get your [tickets here](http://www.ago.net/the-boston-camerata-treasures-of-devotion?_sp=b6cbf7cd44fbd8c9.1484236661041&_ga=1.60431021.1497409904.1484235799) - and get 'em soon. Every live performance I've seen at the AGO sells out and gets packed VERY quickly.
