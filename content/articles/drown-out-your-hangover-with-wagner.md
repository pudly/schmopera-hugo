Happy 2016, everybody!

However you spent your last hours of 2015, it's an unwritten rule that the first day of the new year should be spent on a couch, either recovering from the past or preparing for the future. What better way to get swept up and distracted than with Wagner's *Ring Cycle*? You can get started with this video playlist of the complete *Der Ring des Nibelungen*, directed by Patrice Chéreau and conducted by Pierre Boulez at the [Bayerische Staatsoper](/scene/companies/bayerische-staatsoper/) in 1980. The wicked cast includes Gwyneth Jones, Siegfried Jerusalem, Donald McIntyre, and Hanna Schwartz. 

Get comfy, and turn your speakers up!
