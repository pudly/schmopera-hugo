Let's make no fat-lady-singing jokes; this is just sad. Opera Hamilton announced today that it would "cease operations." The company has canceled its upcoming gala _Popera_, scheduled for Saturday night, as well as its production of _Carmen_ that was set to go up in April. After years of financial stress, with staff still [owed money](http://www.thespec.com/news-story/4288014-musicians-say-opera-hamilton-owes-them-20-000/), Opera Hamilton will turn to Mayor Bob Bratina for a possible solution. Says the mayor, "personally, I would not want to be the mayor overseeing the loss of a cultural asset like Opera Hamilton. I am certainly going to try as the mayor to see what we can do help overcome the difficulties."

Well, that's nice.  For all the sordid details, read [Leonard Turnevicius' article](http://www.thespec.com/news-story/4305929-opera-hamilton-ceasing-operations) in the The Hamilton Spectator.
