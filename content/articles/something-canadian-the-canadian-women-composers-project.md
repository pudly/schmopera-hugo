When soprano Clarisse Tonigussi was on the hunt for "something Canadian" to include on her graduating recital, she learned that it was surprisingly easy to fill a programme with music written by men. "It was in that moment I realized that I need to learn more about the music written by our women, here in Canada."

Tonigussi has not only created a recital programme filled with music by Canadian composers and poets, but expanded her work into what is now the [Canadian Women Composers Project](https://www.canadianwomencomposersproject.com/biography), and taken the programme [on tour](https://www.canadianwomencomposersproject.com/concerts) with the help of pianists Jenna Richards, Narmina Efendiyeva, and Jenny Griffioen.

In historical order, the [hour-long recital](https://www.canadianwomencomposersproject.com/repertoire) brings focus to the music of Gena Branscombe, Jean Coulthard, Jean Ethridge, Carol Ann Weaver, Mary Gardiner, Ana Sokolovic, Jana Skarecky, and Martha Hill Duncan; also on the programme is Rebekah Cummings' newly commissioned *The Way I Dream*, based on Lucy Maude Montgomery's *Anne of Green Gables*, and written for Tonigussi's voice. The music is set to poetry by  Madeleine Guimont, P.K. Page, Judith Miller, Majorie Pickthall, Beatrice Redpath, and E. Pauline Johnson, and Tonigussi wears a gown by Canadian designer [Carly Cumpson](http://www.carlycumpson.com/).

The Canadian Women Composers Project reprises its tour in Regina, Saskatchewan on **September 22**, and continues through Ontario and British Columbia through spring of 2018. Torontonians can catch Clarisse Tonigussi and pianist Narmina Efendiyeva at Gallery 345 on **October 22, 3pm**.

It's an ambitious, thoughtful project, and one deserving of attention.
