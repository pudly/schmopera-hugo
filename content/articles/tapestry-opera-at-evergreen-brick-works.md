[Tapestry Opera](https://tapestryopera.com/) is getting ready for the [world premiere of *M'dea Undone*](https://tapestryopera.com/mdea-undone/), a new opera by John Harris and Marjorie Chan, in the Holcim Gallery of [Evergreen Brick Works](http://www.evergreen.ca/). Based on the Greek myth of Jason and Medea, *M'dea Undone* is a collaboration with Scottish Opera, and features a fantastic cast of Canadians. Mezzo [Lauren Segal](/scene/people/lauren-segal/) stars in the title role, opposite [Peter Barrett](/scene/people/peter-barrett/) as Jason. [James McLean](/scene/people/james-mclean/) is The President, and soprano [Jacqueline Woodley](/scene/people/jacqueline-woodley/) is Dahlia, his beautiful daughter. Tim Albery directs, and rising conductor [Jordan de Souza](/scene/people/jordan-de-souza/) is music director.

I visited Tapestry as the cast was getting a tour of their venue, and Evergreen immediately struck me as a special place. I spoke with Tapestry's Michael Mori, and Lois Lindsay, Program Director of Community Engagement at Evergreen, about *M'dea Undone*, and this exciting collaboration of art and community.
