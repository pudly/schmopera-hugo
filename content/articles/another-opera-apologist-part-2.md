Because one can’t defend opera without defending all of its porous plots:

Right off the bat, let's start in defence of the stupid public. In what I imagine are the thoughts of the average first-time operagoer: Why doesn't [Lucia](http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/history/stories/synopsis.aspx?customid=55) just say no when her brother tries to force her into an arranged marriage? Why doesn't [Violetta](http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/synopsis/traviata) just ignore her boyfriend's dad to when he tries to break them up, waving around Bibles and guilt? Why doesn't [Butterfly](http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/synopsis/madama-butterfly) realize that she simply got knocked up by an [American tourist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini) with no plans for paternal responsibilities?

They have enemies, mentors, and funny friends. Characters like Lucia, Violetta or Butterfly all have in common a drive to be with the people they love. No wonder we experience such a catharsis when we hear their stories; they always boil down to something simple and human.
