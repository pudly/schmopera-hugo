## We need you.
No, seriously, there's a ton of opera-related news, events, and gatherings happening and we cannot be in all places at once. Schmopera is an excellent platform to give some of the younger minds (and seasoned, too) an opportunity to speak up, voice their opinions, and contribute to this community.

## Why Contribute?
This interesting industry of ours has traditionally lacked a voice in a digital medium. There is an inherent lack of candid information around opera, and we feel like more exposure to it would drive more people towards this art form that we all love so much. In order to try to capture as many points of view, we need a variety of people with differing ideas to voice their opinions and thoughts.

## Who can contribute?

- ### Atrists
The stars. We all love you and your audience is continously striving to live vicariously through you. Regale us with your horror stories, your greatest successes, your embarassing moments. On stage and off stage, we are all (almost perversely) interested in everything that you do!</li>

- ### Students
Your opinion is probably one of the more important ones for our industry. We'd love to know why you're doing this, how you're doing it, and what questions you have for the industry as you're leading up to doing this for a living. What are some of the tips and tricks you've picked up while navigating the learning curves and challenges presented in this process?

- ### Parents of students
You are the silent heros of the arts. the relentless crusaders who provide the initial push to the up and comers and the students of the arts. How has your experience been to date? What is it like catering to an aspiring artist? How do you keep your kids motivated, and constantly driving forward?

- ### Teachers and Coaches
Tips, tricks, lessons, life advice, etc., are all welcome! What makes a student shine? What is this industry going to provide the young ones who are interested in it in the long run? How do you get started if you have an interest in this art?

- ### Veterans
People who have been in this industry for many years clearly have a lot to say. Seasoned voices are traditionally the voice of reason and calm. We'd love to know how the industry has shaped itself over the last 5, 10, 20 years, and where you see it going. The directors, the coaches, the stage managers, we're curious to hear your side of the equation in all of this.

- ### Newcomers
Even newcomers are welcome! What would you like to see in the industry? What are some of the question marks or hurdles you've experienced while being introduced to opera? What was your first opera, and why did it confuse you?

## What kind of contributions?
While we're open to anything and everything to do with opera, here are a few examples of the types of posts we're looking for. Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, by any stretch of the imagination, but merely some base guidelines.

- Editorials
- Reviews of shows (especially outside of the areas we cover already)
- Life tips and advice
- Lessons and pointers
- Experiences and introspectives
- What works in this industry
- What doesn't work in this industry
- Humorous obeservations and happenings

## How to contribute

We have a relatively low barrier of entry for you to help us out in making Schmopera the largest source of opera-related content. To that end, all you have to do is drop us an email at [contribute@schmopera.com](mailto:contribute@schmopera.com); We'll ask you a few questions about you, get you to provide some rough drafts, and you're off to the races.

You'll get a little bio page for yourself, some links to your social media, and most importantly, get a personal outlet to speak about this historic and amazing art form.

So let us know if you're interested in contributing, and we look forward to engaging the community as a whole a lot more.
