## THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT.

The Schmopera team consists of [Jenna Simeonov](/authors/jenna/), primary contributor and operatic voice coach, and [Andrej Simeonov](http://twitter.com/dr_drej/), creator of all things technical.

Founded in December 2013, Schmopera aims to present an honest and fresh look at the opera scene. You can read reviews of what's currently onstage, find out about upcoming shows, and get to know the people that make opera happen. We interview singers, conductors, coaches, directors, and teachers, and show you behind-the-scenes as much as we can.
